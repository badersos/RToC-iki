                    <div class="spoiler revealed" style="padding: 1.5rem; min-height: 120px;">
                        <p>His True Body is a being made of Glass True Fire with horns, a dragon tail and sharp, jagged
                            claws on his hands and feet. He wears a white robe woven out of Glass Swords and carries a
                            Wheel made of starlight with a Pure White Three Great Ultimates inside it on his back. After
                            consuming the Immortal beast Pangu True Blood left by Hyeon Rang, his upper body transformed
                            into that of a human.</p>
                        <p>As the Immortal Beast King, He appears to be wrapped around Mount Sumeru in a double helix,
                            with His head resting at the summit, gazing down at the mountain from above.</p>
                        <p>His appearance as the Star Genesis Supreme Deity has skin so pale it is almost transparent,
                            with seas of stars and galaxy clusters flowing beneath it; his whole body is seemingly
                            composed of stars.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Personality</h2>
                    <p>His personality is at the level of being considered a person of character. Even though the pain
                        that accumulates with each repeated return is expressed in the image of a transparent hell, he
                        considers life and all the moments within it to be a blessing and believes that it should not be
                        wasted. <em>'At the same time, I even believe that all sentient beings should be blessed and not
                            be made miserable.'</em></p>
                    <p>Because of this personality, it is natural that he harbors a deep hatred for devilish arts. To be
                        precise, it is an aversion to unethical acts of sacrificing others for selfish reasons and to
                        anything that is based on such actions, and for this reason, he refuses without any compromise
                        or room for actions that involve the sacrifice of others, such as the cultivation pills. This
                        became more in-depth after the 10th Cycle and was sublimated into a kind of identity.</p>
