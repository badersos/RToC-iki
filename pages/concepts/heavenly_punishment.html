            <p><strong>Heavenly Punishment</strong> is a phenomenon faced by all those who defy the heavens. All
                cultivators face some form of Heavenly Punishment during their advancement.</p>

            <h2>Known Types of Heavenly Punishment</h2>
            <p>There exists many kinds of Heavenly Punishments across the Three Thousand Worlds. Though the heavenly
                tribulations belong to the domain of Owner of Heavenly Punishment,[1] it is unknown if the other
                Heavenly Punishments originate from this being. It is later discovered that Heavenly Punishments
                originate from going against the hearts of the greater population.[2]</p>

            <h3>Heavenly Rejection (天拒)</h3>
            <p>Heavenly Rejection is a phenomena that occurs exclusively to all Enders. During the 7th Star Ritual of
                the Qi Refining stage, a Heaven Tribe cultivator has to make a ritual to the heavens during the night.
                The purpose of this is to offer a ritual to seven of the twenty-eight celestial stars governing the
                spiritual nature of heaven and earth that will help the cultivator in their Qi Building stage. This
                ritual will fail without a direct connection to the stars.[3]</p>

            <p>A Heavenly Rejection manifests in the form of dark clouds spontaneously appearing during an Ender's 7th
                Star Ritual. So long as the Ender intended to perform the ritual, the clouds would persist until dawn,
                when the stars would recede. External help would disqualify the ritual, forcing the Ender to remove the
                obstruction with their own power.[4] As their cultivation remained low, many Enders throughout history
                were unable to perform the 7th Star Ritual, eventually dying of old age.</p>

            <p>Under extraordinary circumstances, a mortal who defies their fated lifespan may survive longer through
                sheer will. If the environment doesn't kill them, and if the mortal forces their heart to keep
                beating,[5] a blue-coloured Heavenly Tribulation will descend to kill the mortal.[6] Should the mortal
                survive the tribulation, they will age rapidly and die after 49 days[7] (referencing the Cheondojae, 49
                days of mourning in Buddhism between death and reincarnation). Only Immortal Cultivation or the Heart
                Path can extend a mortal's lifespan.</p>

            <h3>Heavenly Tribulations (天劫)</h3>
            <p>Heavenly Tribulations are strikes of lightning that typically strike the cultivator attempting to advance
                their realm. They typically begin manifesting while advancing to the Nascent Soul stage, and increase in
                intensity as the cultivator's realm rises. A cultivator facing a Heavenly Tribulation may not receive
                external help, otherwise the heavens will be enraged and bring forth a more severe tribulation.</p>

            <p>Enders are burdened with an additional blue-coloured tribulation for every tribulation during their
                advancement,[8] essentially doubling their number of tribulations. They also receive Heavenly
                Tribulations one stage early than others.[9] Some peculiar beings, such as Hong Fan who was born with an
                old soul, receive abnormally calamitous Heavenly Tribulations of titanic proportions — severe punishment
                in return of tremendous power and privileges.[10]</p>

            <p>Certain techniques, such as the Consoling Lightning Ritual,[11] as long as done by "oneself", can help
                make the Heavenly Tribulation less severe. And those who practice Lightning Path cultivation
                methods[12][13] or powerful cultivators at the Entering Nirvana stage[14] may delay a Heavenly
                Tribulation by a small amount of time. Examples range from three days to a year, respectively.</p>

            <h3>Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent — Heavenly Penalty (天刑)</h3>
            <p>The Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent is a living fate born by great being theorized to be Bong Myeong.
                Beings who receive this living fate are born with the fate to 'become the greatest artisans within the
                land they dwell'. However, should they leave their land for whatever reason, they will die. This is
                their Heavenly Penalty.[15]</p>

            <p>The reason leaving their land incurs their Heavenly Penalty is because they break free of their fate
                imposed upon them. Specifically, the fate that they're the greatest artisans 'within the land they
                dwell', whether it be a planet in the Astral Realm, Decaying Corpse Realm, or Middle Realm. There are
                two known Heavenly Penalty in the story, each from different Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent
                bloodlines. The first is tied to the surname of the Jo Clan that Mad Lord Jo Yeon hailed from. Mad Lord
                resisted his fate by connecting his heart with [Her] and forcibly tethered his soul to Bright Cold Realm
                using the ghostly energy of the Nether Crossing Ship's power source he stole.[16] Meanwhile, Buk
                Hyang-hwa's Heavenly Penalty gradually dulls her senses until they perish. Eventually, even her nervous
                system will be paralyzed, and she will forget how to breathe.[17]</p>

            <p>The Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent was likened to 'a bird trapped in a cage' by Mad Lord.[16] It is
                likely that the being that birthed this living fate is connected to the [Bird Trapped In A Cage] symbol.
            </p>

            <h3>Heart Demon Tribulation (心魔劫)</h3>
            <p>When an Integration stage cultivator achieves Grand Perfection and attains all six Divine Powers, a Heart
                Demon Tribulation is added. These are Heart Heavenly Demons, masses of negative emotions and energies
                given personality like Heart Demons. They attack the heart essence of a cultivator from the six
                directions at the Plane of Soul.[18]</p>

                        be from the Owner of Heavenly Punishment.</li>

                        It's essentially declaring to the celestial deities that you are embarking on the path of

                        purpose, but if you infuse it with magical power, it changes everything. Originally, the
                        Consoling Lightning Ritual was indeed used to console lightning. It was quite effective in
                        soothing the Heavenly Tribulation, weakening its power, and aiding in the advancement of one's
                        cultivation realm." —Yeon Wei</li>

                        Jeon Myeong-hoon sacrifices three of his fingers of his Heavenly Golden Thunder Body to
                        temporarily delay the celestial energy. As the celestial energy shifts, the Heavenly Tribulation
                        that should have struck during the breakthrough is postponed for three days.</li>

                    <li>[15] Chapter 440 - "...My fate. Through the norigae, after consulting with Teacher Cheongmun
                        Ryeong... after asking that person, I came to learn the truth. A great being gave birth to a
                        living fate, and this fate spread throughout the world, giving birth to beings who 'become the
                        greatest artisans within the land they dwell, but if they leave that land, they die for various
                        reasons.' This living fate is precisely the true nature of the Extraordinary Pattern Law
                        Talent... My curse...the Heavenly Punishment that began acting up recently, isn't because of the
                        calamity we encountered back then. It isn't your fault either. It's simply...because as I
                        researched the norigae, I began to step outside the bounds of my fate. It's not just about
                        leaving one's physical homeland. Breaking free from the fate imposed on us—that is the true
                        condition for the curse's activation..." —Buk Hyang-hwa</li>
                    <li>[16] Chapter 430 - When the Mad Lord first met Hyang-hwa, he mistook her for one of his own
                        bloodline. He said that in the Head Realm, the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent is actually a
                        Heavenly Penalty (天刑) that only his bloodline bears. But he quickly realized that Hyang-hwa
                        isn't of his bloodline. He said that those with the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent all bear a
                        'curse,' and since the curses differ depending on the bloodline, Hyang-hwa not having the same
                        curse as his is proof that she isn't of his kin. The Mad Lord said that the Extraordinary
                        Pattern Law Talent is like 'a bird trapped in a cage.' A bird that cannot leave the cage... It's
                        the first time I heard it, but he said those with the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent must
                        never leave the world they were born in. Their Heavenly Penalty and curse begins the moment they
                        'escape their world.' In other words...those born with the Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent in
                        the Lower Realms must never ascend. The curse of the Jo Clan...is said to be tied to their
                        surname. I'm not sure of the details but...even though Hyang-hwa's curse is different, they do
                        share some common points. Those cursed are said to eventually die. The Mad Lord connected his
                        heart with [Her]'s and forcibly tethered his soul to this land using the ghostly energy of the
                        Nether Crossing Ship's power source. And Hyang-hwa is...gradually losing the senses of her body.
                        At this rate, not in centuries, but within mere decades, she'll lose all her five senses.
                        Eventually, even the sense of breathing will vanish, and she'll die. —Kim Yeon</li>
                    <li>[17] Chapter 431 - Buk Hyang-hwa's curse is said to gradually dull all her senses until they are
                        completely lost, eventually paralyzing her nervous system and killing her. Though called a
                        curse, it's essentially a Heavenly Penalty that came with her Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent,
                        and there's no way to reverse it.</li>
