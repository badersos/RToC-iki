                <h2>Seo Eun-hyun is a Heart Demon</h2>
                <p>Heart Demons are beings formed by "Desires". Seo Eun-hyun is theorised to be the Ender of Desire.</p>

                <h2>What is the Head Realm?</h2>
                <p>The Head Realm is the skull of the First Radiance Supreme Deity.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyeon Rang and Hong Fan(assumed to be Black Snake) look almost exactly the same.</li>
                    <li>Hyeon Rang also resembles Song Jin. Song Jin's skull structure is the same as that of the Head
                        Realm.</li>
                    <li>Cheon Woon, the Heavenly Venerable of Time, call Hyeon Rang a "substitute" for fate.</li>
                    <li>This further implies the Head Realm and the Akashic Record are under the control of the Radiance
                        Supreme Diety. This is further supported by the fact only Immortal Arts permitted by the
                        Radiance Supreme Diety are allowed to function in the Head Realm.</li>
                    <li>It is also possible the Akashic Records are the anchor for Regression.</li>

                    <p>All the stories say the Emperor/Future King welcomes the Enders<br>
                        And one mentioned the Enders metamorphosing in the [Lotus] (Chapter 323, nun that replaces Tael
                        Yeon-jeol)</p>
                    <p>Maybe...<br>
                        The Ender are part of the Future King, and he uses them as "avatars" or "clones"</p>
                    <p>Maybe he'll try to assimilate the Enders into himself, like a pill.<br>
                        And he needs all seven Enders to do so</p>
                    <p>But, at the same time, his "Ascension" using the Ender-pills will destroy Mount Sumeru<br>
                        Meaning the entire world of Mount Sumeru is his cultivation furnace</p>
                    <p>And Light hates Ender because it has power in Sumeru, and is The Emperor's most loyal aide, who
                        doesn't want to die<br>
                        And since all TI fight against the destruction of Sumeru<br>
                        [Fate] itself stops their advancemet</p>
                    <p>All must reach Heavenly King to be refined into the Ender Pill</p>

            <section id="dreamworlds">
                <h2>"All dreamworlds are actually equally as real as Mt Sumeru" or "Mt Sumeru is a dream"</h2>
                <p>Proof:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Weak speculative foreshadowing (Penglai Island arc): some time after they awaken in Penglai and
                        realise it's a dream, SEH comforts one of his friends by telling them to "treat both Penglai and
                        Mt Sumeru as a dream". However, SEH treats both as real. This could foreshadow how everything in
                        Mt Sumeru could be a dream, and also links to how dreams may become reality in Mt Sumeru.</li>
                    <li>The theme/fact that Seo Hweol's world was a dream in the dream of Head Realm, which could mirror
                        the dream of Head Realm existing in the dream of Mt Sumeru.</li>

            <section id="future-king">
                <h2>Who is the Future King?</h2>
                <p>Hyeon Mu is arguably a fragment of the Future King.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyeon Mu states that all fate that is given must be returned before setting forth to hunt Kim
                        Young-hoon. This implies she is the one who gave the Enders their Fate.</li>
                    <li>Building on this, we also learn that Hyeon Mu was given her position by a greater being,
                        possibly the Future King, meaning that she would also have to return to him.</li>
                    <li>Ender Fates are presumed to originate from the Future King.</li>
                    <li>Hyeon Mu's true body is a Three Great Ultimates formed by black snakes, similar to the [Black
                        Snake] of Radiance.</li>
                    <li>Netherworld as [She] explicitly said the "North" is their most powerful enemy.</li>

            <section id="heart-path-lifespans">
                <h2>Heart Path Lifespans</h2>
                <p>Those who look deeply into the Heart pursue a different path from Immortal Cultivation. Though they
                    may be as powerful, they live significantly shorter lives that Heaven/Earth Path cultivators.
                    However, much about these lifespans are not known.</p>

                <h3>Known information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seo Eun-hyun said the Second Stage of Manifestation gave 49 years.</li>
                    <li>Seo Eun-hyun said the Third Stage of Manifestation gave 343 years.</li>
                    <li>Kim Young-hoon said the First Step Before the Throne gave at least 10,000 years.</li>
                    <li>After reaching Second Step Before the Throne Seo Eun-hyun's lifespan reached millions of years.
                        Though this information is vague, as he had also cultivated up to the Integration stage in
                        Heaven and Earth Paths.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that these lifespan increases only apply to the Human Race. Lifespan increases in all three
                    Paths always scale according to the race's natural lifespan. Dragons with long lives will always
                    receive more lifespan than flowers for advancing in cultivation.</p>

                <h3>Theory</h3>
                <p>This theory is based on the exponential increase between Second and Third Stages of Manifestation, in
                    that 7 x 7 = 49 while 7 x 7 x 7 = 343. Extrapolating from this trend, we will get the following:</p>

                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>First Step Before the Throne is unique in that the pattern changed. While First (7^1), Second (7^2),
                    and Third stages Manifestation (7^3) each only increase by an exponent of one, First Step Before the
                    Throne (7^5) increased by an exponent of two. The reason for this is twofold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>7^4 would only result in 2,401, thus contradicting Kim Young-hoon's statement.</li>
                    <li>7^5 = 16,807 does indeed corroborate the statement, "At least 10,000 years". But it could also
                        reference the fact that First Step Before the Throne is the equivalent of both the Four-Axis and
                        Integration stages in Immortal Cultivation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since Second Step Before the Throne corresponds to both the Star Shattering and Sacred Vessel stages,
                    Second Step should likewise be 7^7, not 7^6.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Third Step Before the Throne only corresponds to the Entering Nirvana stage, so it should
                    be 7^8. A potential corroborating evidence for this is that 7^8 = 5,764,801 years, and in Q&A 5,
                    Tremendous stated that, on average, cultivators take 5 million years to reach True Immortal.[1]
                    Since lifespan is assigned by the heavens, this could be on purpose.</p>

                <h2>Confirmed Theories</h2>

                <h3>The Setting of the Regression Point</h3>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun's regression point seems to fix under the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>He is outside of the Head Realm and in the Interdimensional Void.</li>
                    <li>He has just witnessed an Ender realise their fate.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="quote">
                    <p>Prediction: Regression is not from Seo Eun Hyun's authority, it's a trap. Remember how he wished
                        for opportunity from the heavens in cycle 0 on his deathbed? Sincerity moves the heavens, eh?
                        But is the heavens here.. The Emperor? Light? (Tremendous sure does like pointing to Hong Fan.
                        Tho this one might be a reach.)</p>
                    <p>Whoever it is, if they're savepointing whenever an Ender realizes their fate (which is dangerous
                        for the Enders, for some reason. Maybe cuz if all of em realize can be made into-->Ender pill or
                        whatever) but anyways, I don't think it was intended as a gift.</p>

                <h3>Hong Fan = Black Snake = Light</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    <p>I have a very wild theory. Black Snake = Hong Fan = Light</p>
                    <div class="small-label">— @THEREALMENGHAO</div>
                </div>
                <p>Theory confirmed in chapter 652.</p>

                <h3>Seo Ran is Seo Hweol's main body</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seo Hweol is strangely insistent in Seo Ran's death, even leaving a four-fold plan to kill Seo
                        Ran in the Head Realm. From Seo Li's experience, we know that the death of the "main body"
                        causes the "main body" to reset. Also, the 'clone' cannot directly kill the main body. This
                        implies Seo Ran's death would allow Seo Hweol to switch to a "main body" under his control.</li>
                    <li>After being blinded by the [Chief Judge of the Netherworld], Seo Hweol states he must reach his
                        main body to regain his vision. After this, he make desparate attempts to acquire Seo Ran's
                        blood and/or soul. Since having those items would allow him to access Seo Ran's authority, which
                        would also include regaining his vision, implying that Seo Ran is indeed Seo Hweol's main body.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the Dream World, Seo Ran is always among the first to wake up, usually gaining awareness
                        before Seo Eun-hyun. This implies a large number of being cherish him. It is possible that he
                        gains awareness through Seo Hweol's Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens, which causes the target to
                        'adore' the caster.</li>

                <h3>Seven Enders, Seven Heavenly Kings, Seven Emotions</h3>
                <p>Tae Yeol-jeon's Manifestation possessed seven moves which represent the seven Heavenly Kings of the
                    Buddhist Family Methods. These seven moves seem to represent the Enders. The Seven Brilliances Kings
                    are more deeply connected with the seven Enders, more clearly than the Ender's Tale. Their
                    connection was confirmed when the Sacred Master of Nether Ghost Realm, Yu Oh, called Seo Eun-hyun a
                    Heavenly King designate. The relations are as followed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kim Young-hoon:</strong> The Golden Body Heavenly King, symbolizing the instant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jeon Myeong-hoon:</strong> The Red Pearl Extinguishing Heavenly King, symbolizing the
                        cycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kang Min-hee:</strong> The Lapis Lazuli Protecting Heavenly King, symbolizing protection
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Oh Hyun-seok:</strong> The Silver Basket Heavenly King, symbolizing infinity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kim Yeon:</strong> The Tridacna Vast Cold Heavenly King, symbolizing unity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oh Hye-seo:</strong> The Agate Hatred Heavenly King, symbolizing pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seo Eun-hyun:</strong> The Obsidian Devil Heavenly King, symbolizing filth.</li>

                <h3>Advancement Ritual for True Immortal</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    <p>Alright, so, I’m certain that the ritual to become a TI is killing yourself...<br>
                        Most likely, the TI ritual involves desecrating Fate, by creating another ‘you’ which then dies
                        in your stead...</p>
                    <div class="small-label">— wolven122</div>
                </div>
                <p>This is disproven in Entering Nirvana (개열/開涅) Advancement. While the part about killing oneself, to
                    face "death", is true, the part about desecrating fate is false, as one must actually die, and then
                    leave one's physical body behind to advance.</p>

                <h3>Seo Eun-hyun's fate</h3>
                <p>Various early theories regarding regression not being an Ender ability, trading fates with Hong Fan,
                    and Hong Fan being a RDS were disproven in later chapters (652, 674).</p>

                <h3>Eun-hyun is Guju</h3>
                <p>Assumed out of flashes of memories featuring Hong Fan. Disproven later.</p>

                <h3>True Meaning of Being a Heavenly Venerable</h3>
                <p>Theory posited they must be of the Heart Tribe and achieve Manifestation.</p>
