            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cultivators in The Entering Nirvana stage are called 'True Person' (真人) or Quasi-Immortals. reaching the
                realm of Entering Nirvana refers to reaching the Plane of Fate for Heaven Tribe cultivators and gaining
                control of the Plane of Qi for Earth Tribe cultivators.</p>

            <h2>Advancement</h2>
            <p>The average success rate for Sacred Vessel Sacred Masters advancing to the Entering Nirvana stage is forty
                percent. This is because the advancement to the Entering Nirvana stage is really straightforward.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The formula for the Entering Nirvana stage is Royal Perfection. By adding Royal
                Perfection to the Eight Paths completed during the Sacred Vessel stage to form the Nine Palaces (九宮),
                one achieves the Entering Nirvana stage.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Royal Perfection can be interpreted as a virtue a ruler must possess, or perhaps
                the disposition of a ruler which determines the ruler's direction. And when Royal Perfection is added to
                the Eight Paths—the authority that has manipulated fate and life up until now—the cultivator completes
                their very own Immortal Art!</p>

            <h2>Star Tribulation</h2>
            <p>By the time one reaches the Entering Nirvana stage, the level of Heaven and Earth spiritual energy generated
                within one's body surpasses imagination. Thus, from the Entering Nirvana stage onward, the form of
                Heavenly Tribulations completely transforms. Whereas before, one would [withstand] Heavenly
                Tribulations, Starting from the Entering Nirvana stage, one must [cast down] Heavenly Tribulations. This
                is known as a Star Tribulation.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Completely opposite from the Star Shattering stage, the advancement tribulation
                for the Entering Nirvana stages involves extracting the Star Tribulation from within oneself and
                embedding it into all the stars across the entire Heavenly Domain.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As the Star Tribulation is squeezed and squeezed, eventually, all the true origin
                within a True Person's body becomes hollowed out, leading to death. Enduring this process is the
                advancement ritual for Entering Nirvana, and because of the Star Tribulation bestowment ritual, those
                advancing to Entering Nirvana take thousands of years to complete the advancement ritual. This is why
                they shoot out Star Tribulation in intervals of years.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Seo Eun-Hyun endured this process with the help of Vast Cold's blessing whose
                authority allowed him to control his Star Tribulation, preventing the power within him from instantly
                dissipating into emptiness.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The reason beings at the Entering Nirvana stage can manipulate starlight across
                thousands of light-years is precisely because the Star Tribulation drawn from their bodies remains
                connected to the stars of the world.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>The form of a True Person is so massive that its sheer size approaches that of a fixed star. With the brute
                force of their physical body alone they can shatter stars and kill Star Shattering stage cultivators.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In Seo Eun-Hyun's case his physical body transformed to become a white dwarf star.
                He was also able to change the form of his physical body which would instantly return to being a fixed
                star, then transform into another planet, sometimes becoming a black hole in the universe, and at other
                times taking the form of a blue giant, or even a black dwarf or a brown dwarf.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">At this stage one now also project the main body and create planetary clones. This
                is what Yeo Hwi calls Troubled Star, and is the foundation for her spells.</p>

            <h2>Misconception</h2>
            <p>Cultivators harbor many misconceptions as they believe that accumulating the cultivation of Heaven and Earth to
                reach the Plane of Fate is the method to becoming a True Immortal.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">However this is a massive misunderstanding as reaching the Plane of Fate actually
                refers to the realm of Entering Nirvana or, more specifically, the Entering Nirvana for Heaven Tribe
                cultivators. Earth Tribe cultivators in the Entering Nirvana stage do not reach the Plane of Fate but
                instead gain control of the Plane of Qi. Controlling a plane is the very precursor to becoming a True
                Immortal—the Quasi-Immortal (准仙).</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">From there, advancing to the True Immortal Realm through a specific ritual and
                attaining an Immortal Rank is what is known as True Immortality. For this reason, many already consider
                those at the Entering Nirvana stage to be part of True Immortality. This is what defines the Entering
                Nirvana stage.</p>

            <h3>Vestiges (尸)</h3>
            <p>Vestiges are the shells the Entering Nirvana True Persons (眞人), the Quasi-Immortals (准仙) must shed when
                undergoing Metamorphosis (羽化) into True Immortality. These husks are mostly discarded in the
                Interdimensional Void, surviving for millions of years, attacking those who traverse the void, and over
                time, they break down, weaken, and eventually turn to dust that is expelled into the Astral Realm where
                they nourish the births of new stars.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Vestiges self-destruct when they are struck by heavenly tribulations, whether
                genuine or from the attacks of Heart Tribe members at 3rd stage of Manifestation.[1]</p>

            <h2>Vitality</h2>
            <p>True Persons can perform rituals to the Heavenly Domain to extend their lifespan indefinitely.</p>
