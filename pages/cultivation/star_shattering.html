            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cultivators in the Star Shattering stage are called 'Esteemed One'. This is the stage where one begins to
                become divine.[1] At this stage, Innate Star Star Shattering beings wander the cosmos, spreading bizarre
                phenomenon and expelling dust clouds consumed by Quasi-Immortals to create stars.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The ritual to reach Star Shattering is very dangerous, so many who are at the
                peak of the Integration Stage choose not to advance, even if they are capable.[2]</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">At the end of advancement, the cultivator gains a "star" as a main body. The
                star is typically the size of a moon.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A practitioner of Heaven and Earth Dual Cultivation requires exploding the star
                twice to advance to this stage. Cultivators of this type also have a ring formed around their main
                bodies and winged garments when they are in their Combat Star forms.</p>

            <h2>Advancement Ritual</h2>
            <p>The Star Shattering advancement ritual is notorious for being called a 'suicide ritual' by many Grand
                Perfection Integration stage cultivators, due to its extreme severity.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Just like the Qi Building advancement, one treats all of the cultivation and
                Integrated Dao Domain built as 'Unified Origin' and explodes it. From the explosion, a massive dust
                cloud forms and shapes itself into a nebula. If the 14th stage of Qi Refining creates the Infinite
                Spiritual Cloud, then the Star Shattering stage is about exploding the Integrated Dao Domain to form a
                nebula. Eight to nine out of ten Integration cultivators perish at this point of the Star Shattering
                advancement ritual, with their spirit completely disintegrating into dust alongside the nebula formed by
                the explosion.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Void Refining Dharma Treasure, which an Integration stage cultivator
                synchronises with their Integrated Dao Domain and connects to their heart essence, does not explode even
                during the explosion of the Star Shattering advancement ritual. This is because even though it is
                synchronised with the cultivator, it is still an external object. It remains within the nebula as it is
                still connected to the heart essence, assisting in the reassembly of the scattered spirit and
                consciousness.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">One must use the nebula formed from the explosion of the Integrated Dao Domain to
                create a [real star]. The star that is formed will become the cultivator's main body going forward,
                allowing them to travel across light years through the star's attraction force and wield cosmic
                authority. However, the cultivator has lost all their cultivation. At this moment, having lost all
                cultivation, what is necessary to condense a star is precisely Various Omens.</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Rain (雨)</li>
                <li>Sunlight (陽)</li>
                <li>Heat (燠)</li>
                <li>Cold (寒)</li>
                <li>Wind (風)</li>
                <li>Time (時).</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">With the Immortal Art of Cloudiness (雨), gather the nebula.<br>
                With the Immortal Art of Warmth (燠), raise the temperature at the centre of the gathered nebula.<br>
                With the Immortal Art of Wind (風), shape the center of the nebula into the form of a star.<br>
                With the Immortal Art of Flow of Time (時), begin the rotation of the star.<br>
                With the Immortal Art of Coldness (寒), gradually cool the temperature of the star.<br>
                With the Immortal Art of Clearness (陽), completely solidify the star's form.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Heavenly Tribulation starting from the Star Shattering stage is nothing like
                an ordinary Lightning Tribulation. The Heavenly Tribulation of the Star Shattering stage is also known as
                a Star Tribulation (星劫), a tribulation directly sent down by the stars of the Astral Realm. Unlike the
                Heavenly Tribulations at the Integration stage, which have a set number, the Star Shattering Heavenly
                Tribulation descends as one ray from each of [all stars that shine upon the cultivator] during the
                cultivator's advancement ritual.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">To make tribulations easier, cultivators will sometimes have their breakthrough
                in the Chaos Region of a Middle Realm, where very few stars shine. This must be done with the permission
                of the Realm's Sacred Master.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation Method</h2>
            <p>The Star Shattering stage formula corresponds to the second stage of Immortal Arts; Rain (雨), Clearing (霽),
                Cloudiness (蒙), Want of Connection (驛), Crossing (克), Inner Diagram (貞), and Outer Diagram (悔).</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">To form a new star, one must raise an incarnation to the level of a 'star',
                forming a total of seven stars.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In the Star Shattering stage, the number of stars naturally divides the ream into
                early, middle, and late. At the early stage, only one star is formed. Forming five stars is the middle
                stage. The first five stars, in order, are as follows:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Heavenly Rain</li>
                <li>Heavenly Clearing</li>
                <li>Heavenly Cloudiness</li>
                <li>Heavenly Want of Connection</li>
                <li>Heavenly Crossing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">To reach late stage, one must attach oneself to a larger planet, as a satellite.
                This is needed to gain enlightenment on attraction force.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">After reaching enlightenment, one must form the Heavenly Inner Diagram Great
                Star. To create the seventh star, the Heavenly Outer Diagram Great Star, one must draw in the energy of
                the entire universe through attraction force, reaching Grand Perfection Star Shattering stage.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">If the Immortal Art of the Integration stage, Various Omens, simply manipulates
                celestial phenomena, then the Immortal Art of the Star Shattering stage, Examination of Doubts,
                manipulates planes.</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>The Heavenly Rain Great Star of the Star Shattering Stage engraves the form of Rain (雨) upon the planes
                    of Qi, Soul, and Fate.
                    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>In the Plane of Qi, it manifests as simple rain.</li>
                        <li>Plane of Soul, melancholy infects.</li>
                        <li>In the Plane of Fate, darkness and misfortune gradually begin to spread.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Heavenly Clearing Great Star engraves the form of Clearing (霽) upon the
                    planes.
                    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>In the Plane of Qi, the weather clears.</li>
                        <li>In the Plane of Soul, melancholy disappears.</li>
                        <li>In the Plane of Fate, misfortune dissipates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Heavenly Cloudiness Great Star engraves the form of Cloudiness (蒙) upon
                    the planes.
                    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>In the Plane of Qi, spring wells gush forth from beneath mountains,</li>
                        <li>In the Plane of Soul, ignorance takes root,</li>
                        <li>And in the Plane of Fate, the future grows uncertain.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Heavenly Want of Connection Great Star engraves the form of Want of
                    Connection (驛).
                    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>In the Plane of Qi, vegetation sprouts,</li>
                        <li>In the Plane of Soul, 'transmission' occurs,</li>
                        <li>And in the Plane of Fate, fortune and misfortune are passed on to others.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Heavenly Crossing Great Star engraves the form of Crossing (克).
                    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                        <li>In the Plane of Qi, it begins the hunt of beasts,</li>
                        <li>In the Plane of Soul, patience,</li>
                        <li>And in the Plane of Fate, it symbolises victory in war.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Heavenly Inner Diagram Great Star and the Heavenly Outer Diagram Great
                    Star respectively symbolise the inner and outer trigrams of the Eight Trigrams, serving as the
                    foundation to not only divine one's own fortune but also to subtly interfere with the fate of others.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>This is the stage from which one steps into divinity. This is also the stage where the species and gender of
                s cultivator becomes irrelevant.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Cultivators usually begin producing their own Heaven and Earth energy since they
                are a planet of their own. This usually begins in the middle or late Star Shattering.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Earth Tribe cultivators who reach the Star Shattering realm unlock the true power
                of Earth Tribe senses: namely, the ability to see into the past of any individual. However, the past
                they view must be connected to them in some way or allowed by the person being viewed.</p>

            <h2>Vitality</h2>
            <p>A Star Shattering Stage cultivator has a "star" (meaning celestial body) as their body. Their lifespan
                reaches millions of years. Upon the end of their lifespan, their cultivation is absorbed by the Heavenly
                Domain, and the stars that once comprised their body wander the Astral Realm.</p>
