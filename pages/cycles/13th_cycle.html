            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Eun-hyun awakes to find his regression point has been fixed. He does not reveal the energy of the
                    Formless Sword. The Four-Axis wood-man tells the human race to follow him. Mad Lord says he wants to
                    go to the Light Spirit Pond first, to circulate blood in [Her]. He has a fit and decides to capture
                    the wood-man. He reveals the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress, captures the wood-man and kidnaps
                    Eun-hyun before fleeing.</p>

                <p>After running for a while, the Mad Lord stops and sets base. He opens the Wonderfully Mysterious
                    Fortress, and begins collecting all the ‘materials’ nearby. Eun-hyun contemplates suicide, but is
                    unable to carry it out, as [She] has frozen the heaven and earth spiritual energy. Within the
                    Fortress, Eun-hyun sees puppets behaving as if they are living people and a mental restraint on Kim
                    Yeon. He prepares to strike the Mad Lord when he asks then if they will not greet their master.
                    Eun-hyun hesitates, while the Mad Lord dissolves the restraint on Yeon and tells him he has given
                    her the Red Spirit Ginseng. He introduces himself as the Mad Lord, Jo Yeon. He asks Kim Yeon to
                    leave, and asks Eun-hyun about his Formless Sword and his vision of the heart essence. He then
                    grafts a puppet arm onto Eun-hyun, wondering if he can still produce the Formless Sword that way.
                    After seeing that he can, the Mad Lord tells Eun-hyun to go to his quarters.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun goes to Kim Yeon and tells her about the world. The next day, the Mad Lord gives them The
                    Wonderfully Mysterious Heart Canon, and tells them to use it until Qi Building, when they will
                    receive the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon.</p>

                <p>Half a year later, Eun-hyun has reached Qi Refining 14th star. Both of his arms are now puppet arms.
                    Kim Yeon has failed to break through her Heavenly Rejection. Kim Yeon refuses to use puppet as they
                    make her mind “become strange”.</p>

                <p>A month later, having reached the peak of early Qi Building, Eun-hyun assists Yeon in managing the
                    madness. She successfully breaks through. Right after, the Mad Lord appears, fresh after making
                    another Four-Axis puppet and creating a “mass production line”, ready for war.</p>

                <p>Years later, Eun-hyun has reached Core Formation, while Yeon is at Nascent Soul. Eun-hyun has
                    realised that the Mad Lord has reached an ‘incomplete’ form of Entering Heavens, which grants him
                    sight, but not manifestation. Kim Yeon attempts to get closer, But Eun-hyun rebuffs her advances.
                </p>

                <p>One day, the Mad Lord calls Eun-hyun. He tells him he intends to turn both Eun-hyun and Kim Yeon into
                    puppets to ensure they survive his war. Eun-hyun manages to convince the Mad Lord to only transform
                    him into a puppet under Kim Yeon’s control. The Mad Lord is overjoyed and agrees.</p>

                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="../../assets/images/yeon_crying_puppet.png"

                    <span class="img-caption">Yeon when she learns Eun-hyun is now a puppet</span>
                </div>

                <p>After the transformation into General Seo, Eun-hyun is stunned to realise his soul is housed within
                    the puppet. HE can no longer control his body. Kim Yeon is devastated by this turn of events and
                    vows to avenge Eun-hyun. Eun-hyun realises the circuits within the puppet are steadily replacing his
                    soul, creating an artificial replacement. The centipede he picked up in Ascension Path climbs up and
                    gnaws a key circuit. This allows Eun-hyun to begin taking control of the puppet. Sadly, the puppet
                    kills the centipede.</p>

                <p>Eighty years later, Yeon tells Eun-hyun about the Lightning Harbinger Jeon Myeong-hoon, Kang
                    Min-hee’s strength, Oh Hyun-seok’s happiness, and Oh Hye-seo’s rumoured marriage to Seo Hweol.
                    When the puppet does not answer, she throws a fit. Eun-hyun meanwhile is attempting to take over the
                    Wonderful Mysterious Fortress.</p>

                <p>Five hundred years later, Kim Yeon tells him Jeon Myeong-hoon is still at large, Kang Min-hee has
                    started transforming into a monstrous existence, and Oh Hyun-seok has succumbed to pleasure after
                    the death of the Azure Tiger Saint. There is no news about Oh Hye-seo. Eun-hyun, meanwhile, has
                    realised the mass of intent all the puppets give off is collected by the Fortress, presumably
                    creating a ‘soul’ for [Her].</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun uses all his knowledge to pat Kim Yeon’s shoulder, which catalyses her completion of the
                    Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon, allowing them to communicate using Heart Language.</p>

                </div>

                <p>One thousand years after Eun-hyun’s modification into a puppet, the Mad Lord allies with Seo Hweol to
                    kill Kang Min-hee, who has turned into the Ghost Guiding Holy Mother. [She] is now quasi-Star
                    Shattering. During the fight, a casual strike from the Holy Mother destroys [Her]. Hweol betrays the
                    Mad Lord and seals him with the Holy Mother before teleporting away. A small, green child carrying
                    green podaos, appears with the mission of annihilating both the Holy Mother and the Mad Lord. He is
                    the ‘avatar’ of someone at an equivalent stage to Star Shattering. He introduces himself as the
                    supreme leader of the Heart Tribe, Heaven-Entrapping Esteemed One, Jang Ik, and splits the Fortress
                    in one strike. The Mad Lord survives, fleeing. Kim Yeon decides to use this as an opportunity to
                    shatter [Her] and kill the Mad Lord. She turns a boiling white, resembling a ghost of tangled
                    threads. As Kim Yeon advances, the Mad Lord Jo Yeon regains his sanity and retreats to a hidden
                    layer with [Her]. When she confronts him, Jo Yeon tells her he has been waiting for her to
                    ‘complete’ the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress. As soon as Kim Yeon takes complete control, Jo Yeon
                    activates Yeon’s Play, creating an alternate space-time which feeds off Kim Yeon and Jo Yeon’s
                    lifespans. Eun-hyun rushes to Kim Yeon’s side. He tries to cut her connection to Yeon’s Play using
                    the Formless Sword, but fails. He notices someone has left a green podao in his Sword Hell. Eun-hyun
                    uses Jang Ik’s single strike to break the alternate space-time and “destroy” the Fortress. Jo Yeon
                    dies from the effort of Yeon’s Play. Seo Hweol appears again and decimated the entire area. Just
                    before they die, Eun-hyun and Kim Yeon share a kiss, with Eun-hyun promising to give her his heart
                    again.</p>
