            <h2 class="cycle-title">Axis</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself in the process of regression, thanks to Seo Li’s expertise of Ghost Path
                    Methods and his own Four-Axis cultivation. He is in a [River]. He sees his soul has completely
                    merged with the Colourless Glass Swords, the Soul Bearing Flower and Clear Scale Armour. The Axis of
                    Wealth also follows. He looks up to see the [Heavens]. He recognises ten [seats]; four central stars
                    with [rings], and six outer seats with only one having a ring. As he looks above, he realises the
                    [Oldest One] has sensed his gaze and is now chasing him through the regression process. The Clear
                    Scale Armour increases the attraction force between Seo Eun-hyun and the [Oldest One], so he
                    desperately rips it out of his soul and uses the Soul Bearing Flower. This momentarily block the
                    Owner of the Netherworld, but invites the ire of the original owner of the Soul-Bearing Flower. Seo
                    Eun-hyun successfully escapes and begins his 19th regression.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun returns to the body of the Vestige. He identifies the third attraction force as Ancient
                    Force. He immediately breaks through to Four-Axis with Jeon Myeong-hoon holding off the Tribulation.
                    Hon Won appears and they fight. Hon Won says he will let them go if they endure one strike. Seo
                    Eun-hyun transforms into a giant of starlight with nineteen heads. Both of them use Great Mountain
                    Splitting Emperor. Seo Eun-hyun sees the name ‘Cheon Ra’ within Hon Won, and the latter sees an
                    inverted cone. Mountains begin growing on Seo Eun-hyun and Hon Won begins turning into a salt
                    pillar. The latter recovers first and begins another strike, but is hit by Yuan Yu. Hon Won is
                    weakened. Seo Eun-hyun ponders why he was not severely affected by the name Cheon Ra, even though
                    he’s sure it belongs to one of the ten [seats]. Hon Won’s Supervisory Eye seizes up and he is forced
                    to let Seo Eun-hyun go.</p>

                <p>As Seo Eun-hyun, Myeong-hoon and Hong Fan travel, they are accosted by Seo Hweol. Hweol is surprised
                    at the absence of Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens within Seo Eun-hyun. He once again pretends to be
                    a True Immortal, trying to covertly imprint himself into Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun begins dropping
                    names of Reapers from the Netherworld, taunting Hweol’s claim of being Blood Yin. Hweol attempts to
                    brainwash Seo Eun-hyun by sacrificing personalities, but the Karmic Fire spreads to him instead.
                    Hweol quickly severs the connection, but Seo Eun-hyun reconnects using the All-Heavens Sword. He
                    chases Hweol and fills his ears with [knowledge] while scanning for his secrets. He discovers Hweol
                    has a main body. Seo Hweol self-destructs and escapes.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun, Myeong-hoon and Hong Fan go to the remains of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect
                    and pay their respects. He plans to rescue all his companions, and has Hong Fan teach Myeong-hoon
                    the Six Extremes Yin Thunder Body. Seo Eun-hyun goes to the Grand Nirvana Temple and is shocked to
                    see it ruined. Tael Yeol-jeon has been replaced by a nameless “nun”. This nun’s personality is
                    nothing like that of Yeol-jeon. Inside the Palace, Seo Eun-hyun finds a book detailing the same
                    fairy tales he read in the Head Realm. He remembers an extra chapter, but not its content. He buries
                    his worries for the moment and leaves. He rises to Grand Perfection Heavenly Being in Heaven and
                    discovers his Nascent Soul now acts like an Axis.</p>

        <section id="rampage" class="cycle-section">
            <h2 class="cycle-title">Old Monster’s Rampage</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun goes to Human Heavenly Island and fights for the Position of Grand Cultivator. During
                    the fight, he notices an old man carrying a flower basket. He is reluctantly accepted as a Grand
                    Cultivator.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun takes Hong Fan to the unnamed monk. Hong Fan does not show any attraction to her this
                    time around. They then go to rescue Kim Yeon. Seo Eun-hyun fights the Mad Lord and attempts to cure
                    him, but discovers the Madness is incurable. Mad Lord momentarily regains his sanity, and gives Kim
                    Yeon to Seo Eun-hyun. He also gives her a magic artifact containing his teachings.</p>

                <p>Seo Hweol asks Oh Hye-seo to track Seo Eun-hyun’s history. Hye-seo gives him the information she had
                    collected about him on Earth. Hweol tells her Seo Eun-hyun has been taken over by a high-ranking
                    entity. Hye-seo uses her talent to scan Seo Eun-hyun’s past and discovers he is the same as always.
                    Hyeo-seo plays with the idea of turning into a double agent.</p>

                <p>Kim Yeon observes Seo Eun-hyun’s intent and finds he has the same emotions towards Kang Min-hee as he
                    has towards her– that of an ex-girlfriend. Seo Eun-hyun realises he does not love the current Kim
                    Yeon. Kim Yeon tells Seo Eun-hyun she will persist in loving Seo Eun-hyun until he loves her back.
                </p>

                <p>They join Myeong-hoon at the entrance to the True Devil Realm. Oh Hyun-seok has fallen to Core
                    Formation after being injured. Seo Eun-hyun invites Hyun-seok to join them. They then go to Black
                    Ghost Valley to meet Kang Min-hee. Outside Black Ghost Valley, Seo Eun-hyun sees a projection of
                    Hye-seo invisible to the others. Hye-seo uses her powers to create a formation with the Valley
                    unnoticed.</p>

                <p>Heo Gwak and Heo Ryeong take Seo Eun-hyun into the sect grounds and bring Min-hee’s clone to him. He
                    and Min-hee are aware of Hye-seo. Since no one else can sense her, Min-hee’s main body is summoned.
                    A Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens clone of Hye-seo emerges from Seo Eun-hyun’s shadow. Seo Hweol
                    uses the configurations in Heo Gwak and Heo Ryeong along with Hye-seo’s powers to trap all of them
                    in a pure white labyrinth.</p>

                <p>Hye-seo continues thinking about her double-agent plan. Seo Eun-hyun breaks into the part of the
                    space where Hye-seo and Hweol are and captures Hye-seo. Hweol leaves her behind. Hye-seo pretends to
                    be under Hweol’s influence and attacks Seo Eun-hyun. She begs for death, which Seo Eun-hyun gladly
                    complies with. She flees immediately. Seo Eun-hyun eventually catches her and uses her to manipulate
                    the space, bringing all his comrades to him. He begins questioning her, but Hweol emerges from her
                    shadow to retrieve her soul. He attempts to send the group to the Blood Yin Realm. Hweol sees Kang
                    Min-hee’s absurd talent and attempts to retrieve her. Inside her heart essence, he sees the
                    Netherworld’s right hand man, the Chief Judge, judges him. He begins the descent into Min-hee. Seo
                    Eun-hyun attempts to use Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens to sever the colossal being’s
                    connection. The entity blinds Seo Hweol, making it such that none of his configurations can see, and
                    takes the calamity from Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens upon itself. Seo Eun-hyun attempts
                    to stop Min-hee’s Ghost Guiding Holy Mother Transformation, but she pushes all of them into the
                    Nether Ghost Realm.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>The group summons Yeon Wei from within Yeon Jin. She tells them they are in the Nether Ghost Realm
                    and warns them from observing the celestial energy in the day, as Entering Nirvana True Persons are
                    always observing. Seo Eun-hyun plans to build the Longevity Axis in Nether Ghost. Yeon Wei tells him
                    how to build a Blessings Axes; spread your influence, descend to lower realm through prayers, and
                    exchange lifespan for favours. Accumulating ten-thousand years of lifespan grants an Axis.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun visits the nearby Black River City for information. All the ghosts in the city are too
                    scared to answer his questions. He also notices an old man with a flower basket. Dumbfounded, he
                    finds the city lord, a ghost called Man Gol. Man Gol explains him having a living body and a
                    profound aura of death implies he is a monster who possibly sacrificed millions of souls. As death
                    is suppressed in the daytime, none of the ghosts actually fled on sight. Night suddenly falls. Seo
                    Eun-hyun’s death aura is revealed and the entire city flees.</p>

                <p>Yeon Wei tells them they have landed in the White Yin Domain. There is a Void Spirit Pond,which is
                    one of the requirements for building a Five Blessing Axis, nearby. They conquer the Pond and name
                    themselves the Wuji Religious Order, with Seo Eun-hyun as the cult’s head. The cult offers puppet
                    bodies and welfare benefits for the ghosts.</p>

                <p>Wei Shi-hon of the Death Corpse Sect, Eum Wa of the Shadow Yin Gate and Baek Rin of the White Vein
                    Sect, hold an emergency meeting. Their shared Void Spirit Pond has been captured by the Wuji
                    Religious Order. Shi-hon aggressively pushes for an attack. They lay out all the information they
                    have on the cult, after Shi-hon proposes an attack at night, when the Cult Leader is absent.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun has begun forming his Axis. However, the act of taking lifespan still feels off to him.
                    At the same time, the three Sects begin their attack.</p>

                <p>Baek Rin is startled to see underlings of his own sect among the puppets. The puppet army of ghosts
                    surrounds them. Shi-hon says he will hold the army back and tells the others to advance. Eun Wa and
                    Baek Rin continue to the core of the cult and trapped in a formation laid by Kim Yeon.</p>

                <p>Kim Yeon has been pondering the emotion she feels towards Seo Eun-hyun. She feels it isn’t simply
                    love. She has been practicing her Pair Wings Dance and another method taught by Hong Fan. She keeps
                    Eum Wa and Baek Rin trapped, but they eventually escape. They find a building entirely covered with
                    curses and attempt to enter. However, they are blocked by Wi Shi-hon, who was actually a Guardian
                    Ghost King of the Wuji Religious Order. Wi Shi-ho enticed them into invading the Order in order to
                    convert them. They eventually overpower him and enter the building, only to rush out screaming. Kim
                    Yeon manages to capture Eum Wa, but Baek Rin escapes thanks to her sacrifice.</p>

                <p>Baek Rin’s escape worries Wei Shi-hon as he is owed a favour by an Elder of the Black Ghost Palace.
                    Yeon Wei tells them not to worry as the White Yin Domain is a neutral zone.</p>

                <p>Two hundred and thirty years pass. Oh Hyun-seok has reached the Grand Perfection Heavenly Being stage
                    from the Nascent Soul stage, Jeon Myeong-hoon has reached Grand Perfection Four-Axis stage, and Hong
                    Fan has reached the mid Four-Axis stage. Kim Yeon’s cultivation realm has remained stagnant while
                    her martial arts have improved. Seo Eun-hyun has built 70% of his Axis. The Penglai Island,
                    Underworld Ghost Palace, and Black Ghost Palace have designated the Wuji Religious Order as a
                    heretical cult, and have declared the Cult Leader as the public enemy of the White Yin Domain.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun has found the disciples of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect in the region where
                    corpses of the devotees of Entering Nirvana True Persons lie. He is also worried about Kim Yeon, who
                    has been having bouts of madness. During her madness, her martial strength surges.</p>

                <p>First Guardian Ghost King Wei Shi-hon and the Second Guardian Ghost King Eum Wa are getting married.
                    They send a recording of their wedding to Baek Rin. Baek Rin, who is on the Nether Crossing Ship of
                    Blue Grand Elder, Cha Jo-gwi, goes crazy upon seeing this recording and begs Jo-gwi to annihilate
                    the cult. As Baek Rin is prepared to do anything, Jo-gwi agrees.</p>

                <p>All three cults move their forces to attack the White Yin Domain. Seo Eun-hyun gives a speech.</p>

            <h2 class="cycle-title">Devilish Cult</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>The three sects begin their attack. Seo Eun-hyun uses Great Desert to Dead Sea to absorb all their
                    attacks to power a flying/teleportation Realm Annihilation Ground-Shrinking Formation they have
                    engraved on the White Yin Domain, which is now renamed to Twilight Domain. Myeong-hoon recaptures
                    Baek Rin, also capturing several other ghosts, including Cha Jo-gwi's lieutenant and lover, Yu Hye.
                    Yu Hye has the others escape. In the end, only she and Baek Rin are captured.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself summoned to the lower realms again. He finds himself summoned by Ham Jin,
                    an orphan being experimented on by a devilish cultivator. Seo Eun-hyun realises the valley he is in
                    was created by a creature killed by Jang Ik. He investigates a little, and grants Ham Jin the vision
                    of the Earth Tribe and withdraws.</p>

                <p>The Twilight Domain is again attacked. Oh Hyun-seok begins and advancement to Four-Axis and
                    Myeon-hoon uses the Tribulation to defend the Domain. They teleport once more.</p>

                <p>Yu Hye is now friends with the order. She asks for a transmission device to reassure Cha Jo-gwi she
                    is safe. However, the message distorts due to the teleportation, and make Jo-gwi believe she has
                    been brainwashed and assimilated into the cult, driving him mad with grief.</p>

                <p>The Twilight Domain arrives near the place the disciples of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect
                    are. The land is covered with corpses of ‘devotees’ of True Persons. These ‘devotees’ are ghostly
                    creatures who observed the celestial energy during the day and beheld the True Person, being
                    corrupted. Seo Eun-hyun, Myeong-hoon and Hyun-seok explore the area, looking for the disciples.</p>

                <p>A month later, just as they find the disciples, Seo Eun-hyun has his consciousness pulled up by the
                    True Persons observing Nether Ghost. The True Persons wish to converse with the entity backing Seo
                    Eun-hyun. They treat Seo Eun-hyun like an insect. Infuriated, Seo Eun-hyun uses the Great Mountain
                    Splitting Emperor Technique to show them the [inverted cone]. He confronts them with the fact they
                    have been twisting fate and distorting information about the cult. The True Persons, severely
                    affected by [knowledge], inadvertently lower the pressure on Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun names
                    Reincarnation Judge of the Netherworld, Nether Ghost True Lord Yu Soo Ryeon, whose death formed the
                    Nether Ghost Realm, and returns to his body.</p>

                <p>On their return to the Order, Seo Eun-hyun warns his followers about the threat of the True Persons,
                    but his followers pledge loyalty to him anyway.</p>

                <p>Ham Jin prays to the Wuji Ghost King again. Ham Jin informs Seo Eun-hyun about his master wanting his
                    body, and Seo Eun-hyun reveals his goals for something underneath the valley. He promises to raise
                    Ham Jin to Qi Building within the year. He begins teaching him the Silica Earth Great Wall Secrets.
                </p>

                <p>Ham Jin’s master, Black Tomb Old Monster Yeom Gok is disappointed as yet another one of his disciples
                    has died in his experiments. He feels as if Ham Jin is changing and wonders if it is because of the
                    power at the bottom of the valley.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun wonders if simply giving ten thousand years of lifespan to the Nether Ghost Realm would
                    grant him an Axis.</p>

                <p>The Order prepares to fight the forces of the Nether Ghost Realm. Myeong-hoon worries about Yeon as
                    her cycles of madness have been growing shorter.</p>

                <p>Ham Jin breaks into the Qi Building stage, thanks to the tutoring of Sir Infinite Fighting Ghost, a
                    subordinate of the Wuji Ghost King. Yeom Gok appears overjoyed and tells him he will ‘give him
                    everything’ in three days. He also invites the other Core Formation Sage Gods, to witness his
                    succession (possession). Fighting Ghost tells Ham Jin not to worry and disappears.

                <p>The forces of the Nether Ghost realm begin their attack. Myeong-hoon begins his advancement to
                    Integration stage and confronts them within his Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun has finished gathering lifespans, but feels uneasy looking at the Axis made of others
                    lifespan. He ignores this feeling and condensed his Longevity Axis. Myeong-hoon senses this and
                    delays the Tribulation. Seo Eun-hyun comes out and faces the ‘devotees’ of the True Persons.
                    Myeong-hoon defends the Order while Seo Eun-hyun focuses on opening a sidepath to Bright Cold. The
                    True Persons descend via their devotees and postpone the Heavenly Tribulation. They attempt to crush
                    the Twilight Domain through sheer pressure.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun, despairing, decides to return all the lifespan he has collected over the years. He rips
                    apart the Axis. A [voice] asks him if it isn’t a waste, to which he says it doesn’t matter. The
                    voice commends him and rips apart seven thousand years Seo Eun-hyun had and hands it to the remains
                    of the Longevity Axis. Seo Eun-hyun realises “Immortal Cultivation is repentant enlightenment”. The
                    [voice] agrees and proceeds to tell Seo Eun-hyun the complete formula of the technique, from which
                    the Great Mountain Splitting Emperor is derived. Seo Eun-hyun uses the nameless formula to display
                    an [inverted cone], a mountain of salt. He cuts off the connection the True Persons had with their
                    devotees, and rips open a side path. The Twilight Domain leaves, towards the Bright Cold Realm.</p>

                    Colourless Glass Swords [resonate] with something in the Void and the Twilight Domain is suddenly
                    pushed into the Ancient Force Realm.</p>

                <p>Yuk Yo, a koi demon beast, has partially transformed into a Sea Dragon and is joyfully scamming
                    people, when she suddenly sees a vast island appear in the sky. She is caught by the people of the
                    island and asked if she knows Seo Ran.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun has captures a koi demon bearing the appearance of Seo Ran, The Koi demon, Yuk Yo,
                    confesses to having bedded Seo Ran to steal his appearance, but was caught and chased by Seo Ran’s
                    wife. Seo Eun-hyun has Yuk Yo explain the structure of the Ancient Force Realm. After that, she is
                    led to the honoured guest chamber. Meanwhile, Hong Fan has found and brought Seo Ran and his “wife”,
                    Shi Ho, the white fox from Ascension Path.</p>

                <p>An old ghost and a woman with a norigae attempt to track Seo Ran down. They are terrified when he
                    appears to be within the belly of the being that crossed over from the Nether Ghost Realm.</p>

                <p>Shi Ho smells Yuk Yo’s scent and leaves to assault her. Seo Ran has Seo Eun-hyun erect a barrier and
                    confesses to the fox being male. Seo Eun-hyun finds he cannot say anything to the two men, and
                    wishes them a beautiful love. They share information about Seo Hweol and Cheongmnun Ryeong’s
                    situation. Seo Ran shows Seo Eun-hyun items from the Ancient Force Realm, including a Supervisory
                    Jade. He uses this jade to visit Ham Jin.</p>

                <p>Ham Jin has been worried ever since Sir Infinite Fighting Ghost vanished. The Three Sage Gods of
                    Yuhwa are preparing for the Devil God Black Tomb Old Devil’s inheritance ceremony. During the
                    ceremony, Black Tomb betrays the other two, but is reduced to a Golden Core. The two Sage Gods
                    attack Ham Jin, who manages to hold his own ground until Black Tomb creates a ghost king body and
                    kills them. He takes Ham Jin and Fire Merchant’s body underground. At the bottom of the valley lies
                    a Spirit Jade. Black Tomb possesses the body and implants the spirit jade within himself. Ham Jin
                    suddenly notices his shadow has nineteen heads, which activates a formation Ham Jin had been laying
                    out in the valley on orders of the Wuji Ghost King. Black Tomb attempts to kill Ham Jin, but feels a
                    greater threat. He sees a man in white. The valley suddenly collapses. Black Tomb has Ham Jin drive
                    a flying artifact out of the valley. He starts seeing a hideous ghost king following them.The Wuji
                    Ghost King emerges from Ham Jin’s Inner Core, and kills Black Tomb, seizing the spirit jade.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun examines the formations and finds a droplet-like world. He then withdraws his awareness.
                    Near the Twilight Domain, subordinates of Yuk Yo’s father, the Governing Dragon Palace Lord Yuk Rin.
                    They attack with no warning. En-hyun kills them all, but allows their souls to escape.</p>

                <p>Yuk Rin organises a mission to “rescue” his daughter. A man in a black robe and wearing a bamboo hat
                    also joins. The Twilight Domain is attacked by the Conqueror King’s Fleet. Seo Eun-hyun and Kim
                    Young-hoon have a spar. The Conqueror King, Buk Hyang-hwa, fights with Kim Yeon (waifu wars). Kim
                    Yeon defeats Hyang-hwa, but Seo Eun-hyun, who won the spar with Young-hoon while destroying the
                    laters entire sword collection, stops her from making a General Buk. He then uses the nameless
                    mantra, which resonates with the realm of Ancient Force, and kills all the other warriors. Kim Yeon
                    notices a suspicious bit of intent directed from Seo Eun-hyun to Hyang-hwa.</p>

                <p>Hyang-hwa wakes up to find Kim Yeon stroking her cheek. She takes her to the meeting hall. The
                    Conqueror’s fleet and Wuji Religious Hall hammer out an alliance. Hyang-hwa feels a strange sadness
                    after meeting Seo Eun-hyun. She and Kim Yeon bond over it. The Wuji Religious Order are contacted by

                    Seo Eun-hyun goes and possesses Ham Jin to use the spirit jade. While traveling on the path to the

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun shows the statue to Seo Ran. He tells Seo Eun-hyun it is Lofty Dragon’s Seal (stamp). He
                    discusses his martial arts with Young-hoon and decides to combine all of his techniques into one.
                    Seo Eun-hyun implants Jang Ik’s podao within Young-hoon.</p>

                <p>A hundred years pass. Song Jin has died peacefully. Seo Eun-hyun has realised he does not understand
                    the Canvas. Seo Eun-hyun has condensed the Health axis. Seo Ran and Shi Ho have also advanced their
                    realms. Yuk Rin leads them to Penglai Island. The Twilight Domain enters.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun the charcoal seller wakes up from a long dream. He suddenly remembers his life as Seo
                    Eun-hyun, Wuji Ghost King. He discovers all of his comrades have lost their memories. They all are
                    living happy lives, but Seo Eun-hyun is considered a despicable man. He discovers the world is
                    structured around their memories of folktales from Earth. He visits the forest demon, and discovers
                    it is Shi Ho. He defeats him and goes to Shi Ho’s den, where he discovers Seo Ran, who has retained
                    his memories.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun is aware he must become the king of Penglai to exit the world. He begins gathering demon
                    spirits and creates an army.</p>

                <p>The Scion of the Jin Clan, Jin Ma-yeol, hears about the King of Demon Spirits creating an army. He is
                    confined by his family, but escapes and decides to fight the King. He is joined in his quest by
                    Princess Yuk Yo, Son of the Dragon King Yuk Rin, wandering scholar Kim Young-hoon and a shaman
                    called Baek Rin. They confront the King of Demon Spirits, Seo Eun-hyun, but are defeated in battle
                    and only Jin Ma-yeol and Yuk Rin manage to escape.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Yuk Yo tells Seo Eun-hyun she is originally of this world, and tells him she perceives his world as a
                    dream, not hers. She was born to Yuk Rin and his wife in Penglai. Yuk Rin eventually convinced her
                    and her siblings to exit the world, but once outside he extracted their Sea Dragon True Blood for
                    his own ends. Yuk Yo was left alive as she did not have much blood. She also tells them the walking
                    condition involves having many who cherish you.</p>

                <p>Yuk Yo further tells them Yuk Rin has transferred his ‘main body’ to that of the old Palace Lord, Yuk
                    Ung. Seo Eun-hyun wonders if Yuk Rin is using Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens.</p>

                <p>Wi Yun has been increasing her power through blood sacrifices to the Sea Dragon statue. She receives
                    new orders and leaves to fulfil them.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun returns to the village, He discovers Yeon Wei has awakened and killed Hon Won out of
                    desperation. Jeon Myeong-hoon is awake as well, but not yet crazy. Oh Hyun-seok, whom Seo Eun-hyun
                    had captured, has awakened as well. They storm the palace and enter the throne room. The queen hand
                    over her crown and seal to Seo Eun-hyun. However, before he can do anything, Yuk Rin activates
                    Purple Soul Filling the Heavens in an attempt to take over Seo Eun-hyun body, cultivation, memories,
                    and enlightenment. He barely guessed that it is a secret art that seizes the body, disassemble the
                    memories, soul, abilities, and bloodline, absorbing the advantageous parts, and expelling what is
                    disadvantageous. However, it is lukewarm compared to Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens which bears
                    the name of an Immortal Art as it's rate of corruption is slow while Tainted Soul Filling the
                    Heavens is swift and stealthy. Seo Eun-hyun is sure of something and that is both shares the same
                    root, giving Seo Eun-hyun a clue to Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun invite Yuk Rin's mind into his heart essence. His body writhe and scream in pain as he
                    is torn apart in Seo Eun-hyun Sword Mountain but he still managed to keep is mind intact. Seo
                    Eun-hyun slowly climb up the mountain while inviting Yuk Rin to chase him if he wanted his body.</p>

                <p>Yuk Rin does but he is inflicted with all of Seo Eun Hyun's "pain" but he managed to touch Seo Eun
                    Hyun where the Karmic Fire burns him. He tries to get away from Seo Eun Hyun to escape the pain from
                    the Karmic Fire but all of "Eun Hyun's corpses" grab at his body. He is unable to fight back and
                    escapes from Seo's heart essence by self destructing his mental body. From this encounter Seo Eun
                    Hyun is able to learn Purple Soul Filling the Heavens.</p>

                <p>Yuk Rin returns to his body where he clutch his head in pain and gasp for his breath while groaning
                    in pain and calling Seo Eun Hyun a charcoal monster. Seo Eun Hyun thinks that he briefly touched the
                    Karmic Fire that only has a few embers left and says Yuk Rin is overexaggerating. Seo Eun-hyun
                    starts interrogating him to find what his objective is. Seo Eun Hyun suddenly starts feeling
                    strength from his sleeping body that is outside the formation. He stomps on Yuk Rin, questioning
                    what he is plotting only to know that his plan already began.</p>

                <p>Despite the fact that he couldn't take Eun Hyun's body, Yuk Rin laughs and says he achieved his
                    objectives. It is then revealed that he used the half crazed Wi Yun to completely resurrect and
                    control the former Cherry Blossom Dragon Palace Lord, Yuk Ung, and opening up Penglai Island to get
                    the palace made of Salt Crystals at the summit of Salt Mountain. Seo Eun-hyun and Kim Young-hoon use
                    the one strike of the First Step to create two Heart Avatars to fight against Yuk Rin. Yuk Rin is
                    unable to defeat them even after taking control of Yuk Ung's body so he uses the Salt Sea Returning
                    Dew Jade with the palace made of Salt Crystals to try to win. To this Seo counters using the
                    nameless modified Great Mountain Splitting Emperor Technique (Phenomena Extinguishing Mantra), he is
                    winning, but the crash of the techniques makes the Sacred Master, Hae Lin, intervene and push the
                    Wuji Religious Order to the Deep Sea of Ancient Force to save them from Great Mountain's attention.
                    Yuk Rin then betrays Jin Ma-Yeol and takes Yuk Yo before leaving.</p>
