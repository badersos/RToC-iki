                    <p>Eun-hyun opens his eyes in the middle of a regression. He notices a seat that previously appeared
                        to be watching him has dimmed severely, and feels grateful towards the God of Time. All the
                        Governing Immortals are able to perceive him this regression, as it occurred due to a Heavenly
                        Venerable’s power. Through the power of the Heavenly Venerable of Time, he returns to the
                        instant after the Owner of Great Mountain has annihilated the Twilight Domain. Seo Eun-hyun
                        unfolds his Integrated Dao Domain and pulls in his surviving comrades. The Supreme Deity of
                        Light takes Great Mountain away. Before going, Great Mountain says they will meet [above], and
                        kills ten of the surviving twenty-three.</p>

                    <p>Eun-hyun faces three Esteemed One level vestiges. He realises he must break the star of
                        misfortune, set on him by the Entering Nirvana True Persons he met in Nether Ghost Realm. With
                        the help of his comrades, Eun-hyun succeeds in destroying the star. He lets go of the Salt
                        Mountain of Penglai Island. Yuk Yo and Baek Rin enter the world, and it sucks in all the
                        Vestiges around them.</p>

                    <p>The remains of the Wuji Ghost Cult enter the scroll of Lofty Dragon. Only Kim Young-hoon, Jeon
                        Myeong-hoon, Oh Hyun-seok, Kim Yeon, Buk Hyang-hwa, Hong Fan, Seo Ran, Shi Ho, Yeon Jin, Wei
                        Shi-hon and Eum Wa remain. Eun-hyun gives the Heavenly Lotus Fruit to Gyo Yeom, whom he had met
                        in the eighteenth cycle. Gyo Yeom takes some juice and returns it to him. The remains of the
                        Cult hold a funeral and vow revenge. They have all gotten stronger for having witnessed Great
                        Mountain.</p>

                    <p>Eun-hyun rushes to the Human Race territory, with his friends in his Domain. He warns them about
                        the advent of the Ghost Guiding Holy Mother, but the Grand Cultivators of the Human Race refuse
                        to believe him. On Jeon Myeong-hoon’s suggestion, they begin to forcefully drive the Human Race
                        out of their territory. During the battle, Azure Tiger Saint defects to the Wuji Religious
                        Order. They destroy the Human Tribe’s territory.</p>

                <div class="cycle-content">
                    <p>Black Ghost Valley and Azure Heaven Creation Sect are now with Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun warns
                        Black Ghost Valley about Kang Min-hee’s impending rampage. He orders them to move the Human
                        Tribe into the Heart Tribe territory. The Sacred Master of Bright Cold, Baek Woon, suddenly
                        summons his consciousness into her White Jade Pavilion.</p>

                    <p>Baek Woon asks about Seo Eun-hyun’s experience with Great Mountain. Seo Eun-hyun cannot answer as
                        it involves too many Governing Immortals. He begs her to help them confront Kang Min-hee, but
                        she refuses. She says she must check if he has any attraction force with Great Mountain, and
                        accelerates their consciousness. While checking for attraction force, she allows Seo Eun-hyun to
                        ask questions. She says she merely manages the realm of Bright Cold, and is not required to
                        protect the dwellers.</p>

                    <p>She tells him all Middle Realms are bodies of dead True Immortals. She tells him of the death of
                        Vast Cold, and the fear of a humongously powerful Vestige rising from their body. She says she
                        had to lower her cultivation from True Person to Sacred Master after the death of Lofty Dragon.
                        She says she has summoned Jang Ik, who should arrive in a “mere” five hundred years. She
                        concludes her investigation and gives Seo Eun-hyun a clean bill of health. She allows one more
                        question. She shows Seo Eun-hyun how the Middle Realms are arranged; the corpses appear as if
                        they are reaching towards the Head Realm, the “ominous world”. She releases Seo Eun-hyun’s
                        consciousness. Seo Eun-hyun finds Kang Min-hee is descending. He orders his comrades to take the
                        Nether Crossing Ships and run. He leads her on a chase as she steadily absorbs the resentment of
                        the victims of the Human Race. All of a sudden he is greeted by Seo Hweol.</p>

                        Mad Lord. He says he can temporarily restore Mad Lord to Jo Yeon, and he also needs to find his
                        main body to undo the seal placed on him by the Reaper within Kang Min-hee. Seo Eun-hyun agrees
                        to help him. They dump Kang Min-hee into the Void Spirit Pond near the Heaven Earth Palace,
                        seize Hon Won, and run away.</p>

                <div class="cycle-content">
                    <p>During their run to the Mad Lord, Seo Eun-hyun discovers all of Hon Won’s memories towards Yeon
                        Wei are distorted. Seo Eun-hyun and Seo Hweol invade the Wonderful Mysterious Fortress, and
                        begin ‘curing’ the Mad Lord.</p>

                    <p>They manage to cover up Mad Lord’s most hated memory, and Mad Lord comes to his senses. He
                        immediately attacks both Seo Eun-hyun and Seo Hweol, as he hates the latter. He listens to what
                        Seo Eun-hyun has to say out of respect for his disciple. Kim Yeon’s projection convinces Mad
                        Lord. He agrees to help as long as Seo Hweol remains out of sight.</p>

                    <p>Yeon Wei suddenly sends her consciousness through Kim Yeon. She demands to know what happened to
                        the disciples of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect. She begins calling Seo Eun-hyun “God”
                        and says she realised Seo Eun-hyun has the same aura as the [being] behind Hon Won. She begs Seo
                        Eun-hyun to spare her descendants and take her as his last kill. Seo Eun-hyun is stunned
                        speechless, and is saved from answering when Hon Won confronts her. Yeon Wei once again asks if
                        Seo Eun-hyun will grant her request. Seo Eun-hyun has no choice but to say he is not a True
                        Immortal.</p>

                    <p>After Yeon Wei’s projection has left, Seo Eun-hyun asks the Mad Lord if someone he wanted to
                        protect did not want his protection. Mad Lord says he has never considered it. Then he asks how
                        he looks to the eyes of someone who has reached far beyond his lover. Seo Eun-hyun tells him he
                        is merely half a step away from Entering Heavens Beyond the Path.</p>

                    <p>Kang Min-hee suddenly summons herself into the Bright Cold Realm, due to the Nether Crossing
                        Ship. Buk Hyang-hwa’s consciousness is sent over by Kim Yeon. They create a miniature Realm
                        Annihilation Heavenly Void Formation and teleport to where Kang Min-hee is. With the Mad Lord’s
                        help, they manage to charge the Nether Crossing Ship. Hong fan creates a substitute for Seo
                        Ran’s blood for Seo Hweol to use. Seo Hweol gives a liquid to Hong Fan to pour onto Kang
                        Min-hee. However, Hong Fan inexplicably hesitates on seeing Kang Min-hee, and falls into a daze.
                        Kim Yeon arrives to assist, burning in an unstable pink form. She manifests the bodies of their
                        comrades, and they hold back Kang Min-hee. Seo Eun-hyun manages to enter Kang Min-hee’s heart
                        essence. Inside, he shares a conversation with her, and she comes to terms with the fact that
                        Seo Eun-hyun will never see her as a romantic partner ever again. She tells him that life is
                        sorrow. Seo Hweol’s liquid spills on her. The liquid forms a ‘door’.</p>

                    <p>She is summoned to a place in the Astral Realm where only Seo Hweols exist. This scene is also
                        visible to the Mad Lord, who loses his sanity. Seo Hweol controls the Star Veins and pulls Kang
                        Min-hee in, with the help of Oh Hye-seo and Seo Eun-hyun. She pulls the Nether Crossing Ship
                        towards herself. All the Head Realm Elders of the Black Ghost Valley sacrifice themselves to
                        stop her. Seo Eun-hyun consumes the Havenly Lotus Fruit and rises to Grand Perfection of
                        Integration.</p>

                    <p>As he proceeds, the next Step is visible to him. However, he refuses to swing his sword, as he
                        would be cutting down Kang Min-hee. A voice arises within him, telling him to cut, to swing his
                        sword. He realises what he thought was “enlightenment’ was a Heart Demon raised by the Heavenly
                        Lotus Fruit. He declares his path is one where he cannot sever his connections and charges
                        forward. He realises the Heavenly Lotus Fruit contained the split soul of Blood Yin. He rips out
                        the remaining influence. He moves forward, undeterred, despite Kang Min-hee trying to make him
                        leave. He enters her Heart Essence, and embraces her. He orders All Heavens to strike, dying
                        with Kang Min-hee in his arms.</p>

                <div class="cycle-content">
                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun comes out of the regression only to find the regression point has inexplicably been
                        fixed once again. He is now standing on the Nether Crossing Ship, moments before Heo Gwak and
                        the others sacrifice themselves. At the same time, He feels a strong sense of disgust. He
                        carefully unleashes a single strike of the Second Step and succeeds in pushing Kang Min-hee into
                        the Astral Realm. He embeds the Heavenly Lotus Fruit containing Blood Yin’s split soul in Kang
                        Min-hee’s bosom, preventing Seo Hweol from making a move on her. He uses the Dao of the Heart
                        Sword to create the Sub-Heart Sword, Transcending Mountain Ridge Embedment. Seo Eun-hyun falls
                        into the Heart Tribe territory after, exhausted by his move.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun wakes up in Buk Hyang-hwa’s lap. She tells him they are in Cedar Wood Grove, and the
                        Heart Tribe’s Supreme Council wishes to meet him. She also tells Seo Eun-hyun she will track the
                        connection between her norigae and his Canvas. Seo Eun-hyun reluctantly lets her. He goes
                        outside to see Kim Young-hoon sparring against avatars of the Heart Tribe Supreme Council. Kim
                        Yeon tells him about the status of the Human Race and reveals Buk Hyang-hwa is about to die due
                        to the backlash of her Law Pattern Talent, which does not allow the wielder to exceed their
                        fate. Grand Cultivator Gol asks for Seo Eun-hyun’s forgiveness at not trusting him. Seo
                        Eun-hyun, devastated by Buk Hyang-hwa’s death steps into the field where Kim Young-hoon spars.
                        He spars with all of them at once, before stopping. He asks their stance on the Human Race, and
                        they agree to let them live if Seo Eun-hyun exchanges a genuine single strike with one of them.
                        Seo Eun-hyun, afraid of killing them, initially refuses, but agrees after seeing their will. The
                        strike kills the swordsman of the Small Person Race, Gyeong Chang, Jang Ik’s senior most
                        disciple.</p>

                    <p>After the duel, Seo Eun-hyun is guided to a shrine and told to consolidate his understanding of
                        the Second Step Before the Throne. Within the shrine, Seo Eun-hyun infuses all the power of the
                        Canvas into the Colourless Glass Swords, as he can now keep his across regressions. Through
                        emptying the Canvas, he solidifies his realisation and names his realm Void Shattering. As a
                        result, he can now completely embody the feelings in his history. He exits the cage to find ten
                        years have passed. In those ten years, Baek Woon has declared him an Esteemed One. Buk Hyang-hwa
                        tells him she has found there is a similarity beteween Seo Eun-hyun’s Canvas, Ancient Force, and
                        the Head Realm. She says she must investigate the norigae, which was made by her mother. Seo
                        Eun-hyun realises he has now cast off his obsession, as the dark blue of sorrow around him has
                        been replaced by the blue of sadness. He leaves to check his Esteemed One title. He is given a
                        scroll and opens it using a single strike of Void Shattering.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun discovers he has been granted a star (celestial body) named Within Heavens, as his
                        Esteemed One title. Seo Eun-hyun is displeased by the name due to its implications, and meets
                        with Baek Woon. Baek Woon offers several names, but all contain the characters for ‘light’ or
                        ‘heaven’, which Seo Eun-hyun cannot accept. Baek Woon tells him he must accept a title, as all
                        Esteemed Ones of the Bright Cold Realm must have the characters of light or heaven to avoid
                        falling into the Four Realms of Death. Seo Eun-hyun still refuses a title, and Baek Woon
                        attempts to force on on him. She claims he is her sucessor. Seo Eun-hyun steps back to the Heart
                        Tribe territory, and brings Jeon Myeong-hoon with him to Baek Woon, They attempt to remove the
                        lighting spears from Baek Woon’s body, but it causes her immense pain, and they fail. The entire
                        Bright Cold Realm views this as an attack on their Sacred Master. As a result she drops to Star
                        Shattering, and Bright Cold is temporarily left without a Sacred Master.</p>

                    <p>Due to Baek Woon’s fall, Bright Cold is being invaded by Vestiges. Seo Eun-hyun uses the Supreme
                        Council as ‘terminals’ to wipe out all Vestiges. Yu Yeon, one of Jang Ik’s disciples, spars with
                        Seo Eun-hyun. She tells him she has always been with Gyeon Chang, and they become disciples of
                        Jang Ik together. She sheds her shell and her desire to follow her senior brother echoes through
                        her heart. As she perishes, Seo Eun-hyun awakens the Divine power of Wind.</p>

                    <p>As the years pass, Buk Hyang-hwa grows weaker. Twenty years after their arrival in Cedar Wood
                        Grove, Ryeo Hwa asks Seo Eun-hyun for a duel. She explains she is not the Ryeo Hwa Seo Eun-hyun
                        met twenty years ago, but a flower carrying their memories. She says she intends to pass on the
                        existence of Ryeo Hwa to Seo Eun-hyun. They duel, ending with Ryeo Hwa’s Flower Soul passing on
                        to Seo Eun-hyun. As she dies, Seo Eun-hyun awakens the Divine power of Cold. Purple Soul Filling
                        the Heavens fuses with her Flower Soul to evolve into Flower Soul Filling the Heavens. As Flower
                        Soul Filling the Heavens settles into his body, Seo Eun-hyun recalls a memory from the distant
                        past he had forgotten- back in Seoak Village, when he met the child’s [sister].</p>

                        itself. She reveals cultivating the Heart leads to the End of the universe, as Vast Cold altered
                        the condition to be as as such. She offers to raise Seo Eun-hyun to True Immortal immediately if
                        Seo Eun-hyun stops cultivating the Heart. Seo Eun-hyun begins to accept, when he has a flashback

                        and warns him to beware of the “North”.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun returns to the present, and finds Hong Fan in front of him. He thanks Hong Fan for
                        staying by this side, and they bury Ryeo Hwa.</p>

                    <p>Twenty years pass. Seo Eun-hyun succeeds in subduing Jae Hu, another of the supreme council,
                        without killing him. He has awakened all Divine Powers but that of Rain. Kim Young-hoon finds
                        him and tells him he is being challenged by Buk Hyang-hwa. She uses the norigae, displaying
                        various spells and abilities through it. As he dances through the moves, he sees his marriage
                        with her in the 10th Cycle. He awakens the Divine Power of Rain, and shatters the circle Buk
                        Hyang-hwa had made. She has succeeded in reaching [that person]. She gives Seo Eun-hyun the
                        norigae and tells him she has found a pathway to where Cheongmun Ryeong is. She tells her her
                        Law Pattern Talent is from a great being she had often dreamt of in the form of a bird. She says
                        she is dying as she tried to research the norigae. She declares she will escape her fate and
                        enters Penglai Island, where Cheongmun Ryeong is. Hyang-hwa turns into salt and passes. The
                        norigae has now turned to Salt Crystal. Seo Eun-hyun tells everyone they can enter the world
                        Hyang-hwa went- for that, they must kill the Mad Lord.</p>

                    <p>In one of the Tall Tree Race’s colonies, the Mad Lord has set camp. He is amused to note one in
                        every ten harbour malicious desires towards Baek Woon. He is preparing to grind down the entire
                        Bright Cold Realm to create an Artificial Star for [Her]. Meanwhile, Seo Eun-hyun and his
                        comrades begin their mission. They break into the Wonderfully Mysterious Fortress. Seo Eun-hyun
                        fights [Her], and manages to unveil her face. They continue fighting. When Seo Eun-hyun tells
                        [Her] to disappear, he hears a voice refute him, and [She] returns to the Fortress. Inside, Mad
                        Lord has a fit of anger and vows to capture all of Seo Eun-hyun’s comrades.</p>

                    <p>Kim Yeon recalls her life. She remembers her shame at not truly loving Seo Eun-hyun. She creates
                        a clone out of her desire, and a pure-white Kim Yeon forms. She attempts to enter the control
                        room, but sees Oh Hye-seo instead. Oh Hye-seo tells Kim Yeon Seo Hweol’s ‘superior’ will soon

                    <p>Seo Hweol tells Seo Eun-hyun the story of Blood Yin. The Yu Hao Te of Vice planned to take over
                        Vast Cold’s body and regain their former authority. The Yu Hao Te of Vice had a terrifying war
                        with Yu Hao Te’s Immortal Treasure, Sae Eum, and the successor of Ancient Force True Lord, known
                        as Lofty Dragon. Lofty Dragon and Sae Eum sacrificed themselves to shackle Blood Yin with his
                        name. And thus, True Devil and Blood Yin Realm were made. Blood Yin panned to create a new seat,
                        and then merge it with his Seat of Vice.</p>

                    <p>Seo Hweol asks Seo Eun-hyun about Seo Ran. Seo Eun-hyun refuses to cooperate if Seo Hweol tries
                        to harm Seo Ran. Seo Hweol agrees and they form an alliance.</p>

                    <p>Once back outside, Seo Hweol reveals the Mad Lord’s Fortress contains the power of Vast Cold, and
                        can be used to fight against Blood Yin. At that moment, the Seven Esteemed Ones of an Era of
                        Blood Yin arrive to destroy the Fortress. Seo Eun-hyun decides to attack them.</p>

                    <p>Due to the arrival of the Esteemed Ones, all but Hong Fan are immobilised. Mad Lord, in his state
                        of pain, asks if Kim Yeon is ready. Seo Eun-hyun says he does not know. He retrieves the essence
                        avatar of Jang Ik from Kim Young-hoon and faces the Esteemed Ones. Using 19 of the 22 he holds,
                        he destroys five of the seven projections.</p>

                    <p>Back in the Fortress, Kim Young-hoon has succeeded in freeing himself from the coral. He agonises
                        about advancing to Void Shattering. He finds his own enlightenment, and manages a Single Strike
                        of the Second Step, injuring Gyu Cheon, one of the Esteemed Ones. Dues to Blood Yin encroaching
                        into the Bright Cold Realm, the Esteemed Ones summon their main bodies. Mad Lord is
                        incapacitated, which means Yeon’s Play cannot be activated. Seo Hweol says he can help heal the
                        Mad Lord, by reviving his memories and erasing Blood Yin’s taint.</p>

                <div class="cycle-content">
                    <p>At the age of ten, Jo Yeon awakened his talent, a Seven-Coloured Extraordinary Law Pattern
                        Talent. Jo Yeon was bullied and mistreated by his peers, and later conducted the funeral of his
                        abusive father. Jo Yeon reached Qi Building within twenty years before leaving to wander the
                        martial world. He found his mother’s grave, paying his respects, when he was confronted by Wol
                        Bi, a member of the family his mother had been sold to. They spar, which ended in Wol Bi’s loss
                        and a lifelong friendship. They parted way five years later, Wol Bi to find a disciple and Jo
                        Yeon to return to his clan.</p>

                    <p>Ten years later, Jo Yeon brought his perfected gift for Wol Bi to the ruins of the Wol Clan. His
                        Clan, the Jo Clan, had destroyed them. Jo Yeon destroyed the three martial sects requesting the
                        Wol Clan’s annihilation, where he met Wol Bi’s disciple. Overjoyed, he fights her, and loses,
                        exalting in the progression of Wol Bi’s legacy. She introduces herself as Wol Ha-eun.</p>

                    <p>Wol Ha-eun and Jo Yeon roamed the martial world together. They arrived in Seoak Village and
                        rescue the villagers from a Black Snake. However, Jo Yeon as poisoned by the Snake. To prevent
                        this from happening again, Wol Ha-eun taught him some basic steps. As they danced together, they
                        acknowledge their love for each other. One day, when they entered a restaurant, just as Jo Yeon
                        is about to ask her hand in marriage, they are accosted by a man in tattered robes, claiming to
                        be the father of one of the beasts they had slain. They are chilled by the man’s gratefulness
                        and indifference. He suddenly asked for the couple to split, which they naturally refuse. After
                        the man who threatens them left, Wol Ha-eun asked Jo Yeon’s hand in marriage, which he
                        gratefully accepts. Through this, Jo Yeon became a Six-Patterned Law Talent, and they promised
                        to exchange vows under the quince tree. However, Jo Yeon was suddenly recalled by his clan and
                        told to marry. He refused, citing Wol Ha-eun, but is punished for it. He was locked in a room
                        with a brainwashing barrier. He reverse engineers it and escapes, and runs to the quince tree,
                        where Wol Ha-eun awaits him. They carried out the wedding ceremony, and became husband and wife.
                        However, they are caught by the Elder of the Jo Clan. He demands Wol Ha-eun and Jo Yoen be
                        separated for twenty years. Jo Yeon swore to raise his cultivation to Core Formation by that
                        time.</p>

                    <p>While in training, a late-stage disciple born with the Five-Pattern Law Talent gave Jo Yeon three
                        Emotion Advancement Pills. Jo Yeon felt odd, but took the pills anyway.</p>

                    <p>Ten years after confinement, Jo Yeon exits at the Core Formation Stage, as a Four-Pattern Law
                        Talent. He is given an artifact to track Wol Ha-eun down. He follows the artifact to the pill
                        refining chamber. The late-stage disciple who gave him the pills taunts him, telling she was
                        refined into pills, the same pills Jo Yeon ate. Jo Yeon was forced to ignore it, due to the
                        discple’s uncle being at Grand Perfection Core Formation.</p>

                    <p>That day Jo Yeon went mad.</p>

                    <p>Six hundred years passed. The Jo Clan were planning their takeover of the Head Realm, when Jo
                        Yeon entered the room. He had become a One-Pattern Law Talent. Jo Yeon told them to either bring
                        his wife back or to ask for her forgiveness. He killed an Elder who tries to object. The ten
                        Heavenly Being Supreme Elders also appeared. Jo Yeon revealed [Her], a puppet at the Grand
                        Perfection of Heavenly Being. He began to refine Emotion Advancement pills of all of his clan
                        members. As he sobbed in agony, having eaten the entire Jo Clan, he vowed to meet Ha-eun again,
                        and declared himself the father of monsters.</p>

                    <div class="info-card">

                    <p>Back in the present, Seo Eun-hyun questions the Owner of Salt Moutain’s repentant enlightenment.
                        Seo Hweol warns Seo Eun-hyun, as devilish energy enters his body. An illusion of Cheongmun
                        Ryeong appears from Seo Eun-hyun’s Canvas, which tells him to get a grip. Seo Eun-hyun
                        acknowledges the knowledge he has given himself, and advances. Seo Eun-hyun tells the Mad Lord
                        he is a sinner. However, his Her accumulated everything on her own. Her heart remains whole
                        inside him. Mad Lord reaches Entering Heavens Beyond the Path... Heart of Love.</p>

                    <p>Mad Lord and [Her] begin to dance, and all negative emotions are wiped away. He draws out a pink
                        hue onto Kim Yeon’s white form. Yeon’s Play is activated. As the play ends, Jo Yeon apologises
                        to Kim Yeon, and gives her a quince flower made of his and [Her]’s Qi. Jo Yeon takes out two
                        cups of White-Red wine and sets one in front of [Her]. He drinks the wine with the last of his
                        strength… and [Her], moving on her own, pours the wine on [Her] face, as if drinking.</p>

                    <p>Kim Yeon accepts the flower, and come to realies Love is infact, every emotion. She suddenly
                        arrives at place she has never been before. A being behind a Peach Blossom Tree tells her they
                        believe Immortal Cultivation is Progress. They tell her she has always been moving forward, and
                        says her heart has never changed, merely expressed it differently. The being tells her they are
                        the Seat Holder of End, Tridacna Vast Cold Heavenly King. Kim Yeon returns to the top of the
                        Fortress and begins dancing. She reaches her own Entering Heavens Beyond the Path, Full Blossom.
                        Thanks to her, Blood Yin is pushed back.</p>

                        forth to confront Blood Yin. Blood Yin attempts to seduce Seo Eun-hyun, but Seo Eun-hyun
                        resists. Seo Eun-hyun attempts to convince Blood Yin to give up on Vast Cold’s body, but Blood
                        Yin refuses, saying only They are worthy. Seo Eun-hyun vows to save Baek Woon, whom Blood Yin
                        has captured, and begins fighting Blood Yin. Blood Yin attempts to judge Seo Eun-hyun, but Seo
                        Eun-hyun is already under the effect of Karmic Fire. Blood Yin takes a mental hit, believing the
                        Reapers stand against him. Seo Eun-hyun uses this moment to dig out Baek Woon, and uses Jeon
                        Myeong-hoon to strike tribulation on her. They successfully drive out Blood Yin’s will. Blood
                        Yin takes offense and tries to bring his main body over. Baek Woon summons the Radiance Eight
                        Immortals to stop Blood Yin. Due to the light, the norigae opens a path into the place where
                        both Cheongmun Ryeong and Buk Hyang-hwa are. As they escape, Blood Yin prophecies they will meet
                        in a hundred years. As they are sucked into the dream world, Seo Hweol attempts to kidnap Seo
                        Ran, but is stopped by Seo Eun-hyun. He breaks into mad laughter when Seo Eun-hyun called Seo

                    <p>Baek Woon is restored to her former glory by the Radiance Eight. She sees the norigae, and throws

                <div class="cycle-content">
                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun awakens to find he is back in Ascension Path, and Seo Ran is in place of Kang
                        Min-hee. After putting everyone to sleep, Seo Eun-hyun realises he is in a world similar to
                        Penglai. The world appears to based off their memories of Ascension Path and Earth, having
                        plants only found in the latter place. Seo Ran approaches Seo Eun-hyun and says he has some of
                        his memories. They return to the others and settle down into a cave. Seo Eun-hyun attempts to
                        suck in the Qi of the surrounding world, but finds very small amounts of it existing. Due to the
                        absence of Qi, Seo Eun-hyun cannot fully use the Canvas. A two-headed creature appears, calling
                        itself master of the forest. In return for letting them be, it demands an arm and sexual
                        favours. Seo Eun-hyun refuses. The snake takes offense and tries to attack, but is rebuffed by
                        Seo Eun-hyun. The defeated snake is the concubine of Shi Ho, one of the Three Rulers of the
                        continent. The snake has information that leads them to believe it has been 10,000 years since
                        their ascension. The Three Powers are Supreme Elder of the Azure Heaven Creation Sect, Cheongmun
                        Sunwoo, Salt Sea Master Cheongmun Ryeong and Heavenly Chess Piece Shi Ho. While in the cave,
                        someone tells Seo Eun-hyun he brought the snake in the first time he entered, and says they
                        won’t forgive Seo Eun-hyun if it happens again. Seo Eun-hyun promises to be careful before
                        realising he has no idea who he is talking to.</p>

                    <p>The rest of Seo Eun-hyun’s comrades wake up. They are bewildered by the current situation. The
                        snake, Twin-Head, and Seo Eun-hyun orchestrate an act to convince the others they are no longer
                        on Earth. Twin-Head then gives all of them a ride. They soon reach the edge of Ascension Path,
                        where Seo Eun-hyun discovers the island is now resting on the desert sands. As they traverse the
                        desert to the Eastern Tribes, Twin-Head explains the world they find themselves in. They
                        eventually arrive at the nation of Manli and settle down there.</p>

                    <p>Ten years pass. Seo Eun-hyun has become the strongest in the East, and has created a martial art
                        that mimics the Formless Sword. He plans to retrieve an “item” given to a local tribe leader.
                        Seo Ran has been having fits in this world. Oh Hyun-seok steals the item and they flee to the
                        Western Nations.</p>

                    <p>They arrive at Cheon-eum city, formerly Cheon-saek city. Seo Eun-hyun is confused as the layout
                        of the Cheon-saek city thousands of years ago and the current Cheon-eum city remain the same. He
                        learns Cheongmun Ryeong is in Shengzi and follows him there. Seo Eun-hyun goes to attend Salt
                        Sea’s dharma ceremony, when a few ruffian exhort him for a proper seat. The ruffians are pushed
                        aside by a tall one wrapped in bandages. They are Cheongmeon Ryeong’s only disciple. They tell
                        Seo Eun-hyun to get lost, but Seo Eun-hyun refuses. They begin fighting. The tall one says they
                        will kill Seo Eun-hyun as only one disciple is enough, and only Seo Eun-hyun seems worthy
                        enough. During their battle, Seo Eun-hyun glances at a merchant ship, which his opponent
                        destroys out of spite. Suddenly Seo Eun-hyun notices the flag of the ship is Penglai’s. One of
                        the seamen in the fallen ship tells Seo Eun-hyun Penglai is on the other side of the planet. Seo
                        Eun-hyun is stunned to learn this world is round, not flat.</p>

                    <p>While Seo Eun-hyun and the bandaged monster fight, the latter makes a hand seal and uses the
                        deaths of the sailors for a spell using water. The sea of blood attempts to trap Seo Eun-hyun,
                        forming a massive red crystal. Seo Eun-hyun uses the item of the Eastern Tribes, the Howling
                        Resplendent Sword, and breaks through. They fight until Seo Eun-hyun loses, with the bandaged
                        man mocking his swordmanship.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun wakes up to find a physician resembling Buk Hyang-hwa tending to him. The bandaged
                        monster is also there, but he says he will no longer try to kill Seo Eun-hyun as his master
                        forbade it. The physician introduces herself as Baek Ran. Seo Eun-hyun thanks her and exits the
                        room. He finds himself in a large courtyard. The bandaged one says Seo Eun-hyun may participate
                        for the selection here. He also says he will kill Seo Eun-hyun if he fails, and guides him to
                        Cheongmun Ryeong. The latter gives Seo Eun-hyun a basic cultivation manual and gives Seo
                        Eun-hyun a plum, with the instructions of never taking it out of his mouth. Seo Eun-hyun agrees
                        and goes to work</p>

                    <p>While doing chores, he notices some take the plum out of their mouths. The plums appear rotten,
                        which confuses Seo Eun-hyun. His plum remains unspoiled.</p>

                    <p>A month passes. Seo Eun-hyun notices he is losing strength, but his heart becomes cleared the
                        more he practices the nameless method. Only four contenders remain. Gak Am, Cheongmun Ryeong’s
                        only disciple, calls them out and transmits his master’s words, telling them to remember the
                        plum when they are hungry or thirsty. Yet another month passes. Seo Eun-hyun and one other
                        remain. The other disciple spits the plum out in anger, complaining about the wasting away of
                        her beauty and leaves.</p>

                    <p>Four more months pass. Seo Eun-hyun’s fingernails are dropping of his hands. He hasn’t eaten food
                        nor drunk water for a month yet remains alive. As he sweeps the estate, he wonders why he
                        obsesses over his connections. As he ponders, he suddenly perceives the form of Great Mountain.
                        Snapping to his senses, he realises it is the bandaged one, Gak Am. Gak Am begins whipping him,
                        calling him lazy. Seo Eun-hyun looks into their eyes and realises Gak Am is afraid Seo Eun-hyun
                        will succeed. Gak Am asks him if Seo Eun-hyun isn’t afraid of death. Seo Eun-hyun says he is
                        not, as he has found his Dao, the Dao of Myriad Forms and Connections. Seo Eun-hyun has also
                        realised he has succeed the test. Gak Am tells Seo Eun-hyun their name is actually गा ॐ. Seo
                        Eun-hyun cannot pronounce it, so calls them Gwak Am instead. Cheongmun Ryeong appears,
                        congratulating Seo Eun-hyun on passing the test and beginning his education in Immortal Arts.

                    <p>Cheongmun Ryeong taps Seo Eun-hyun’s back, and all of his vitality is restored. Seo Eun-hyun asks
                        him to take a look at Seo Ran, so his Master sends Gwak Am with Seo Eun-hyun. Gwak Am clears Seo
                        Ran’s head, curing her madness. Due to the ‘treatment’, Kim Young-hoon is sent to fetch Baek
                        Ran.</p>

                    <p>Cheongmun Ryeong begins Seo Eun-hyun’s education in Immortal Arts. Cheongmun Ryeong teaches him
                        how to change the world through the power of his heart. The primal forms are in fact, the same
                        as the Divine Powers at the Integration stage. Cheongmun Ryeong tells Seo Eun-hyun Immortal
                        Cultivation is someone’s Immortal Art, twisting the original system of the Heart into one where
                        the practitioner gained power and authority.</p>

                    <p>Nearly hundred years pass. Oh Hyun-seok is an assassin on a mission to kill a group of
                        barbarians. He arrives after the targets have finished a raid and kills them. Inside the
                        destroyed village, he discovers an orphaned child. Meanwhile, Seo Eun-hyun has come to
                        understand the Immortal Arts Various Omens; Examination of Doubts; Five Epochs, Three Spirits;
                        and Eight Paths, One Extreme. Cheongmun Ryeong tells Seo Eun-hyun the rest of his training must
                        happen outside the Dream World. For the last thirty years, he has been prolonging his lifespan
                        solely to teach Seo Eun-hyun. Cheongmun Ryeong asks Gwak Am to refrain from killing Seo Eun-hyun
                        before he is strong enough. Seo Eun-hyun must complete his own Immortal Art, but Cheongmun
                        Ryeong says effort alone won’t be enough. He tells Seo Eun-hyun and Gwak Am to travel to the
                        west and east for several years.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun goes to where his friends are staying. Baek Ran is now incredibly old. She tells
                        them of a dream she had, which mirror Buk Hyang-hwa’s memories. Kim Yeon is the only one other
                        than Seo Ran and Seo Eun-hyun to regain her memories. Seo Eun-hyun takes all of his comrades on
                        his journey. Kim Yeon stays behind to look after Baek Ran. Oh Hyun-seok says he must find a
                        proper family for the girl he has picked up.</p>

                <div class="cycle-content">
                    <p>The group arrives in Pengali, where they meet Yuk Yo and Baek Rin. Seo Ran is for some reason
                        anxious on seeing her. Yuk Yo tells Seo Eun-hyun the hidden light began to turn an ominous red
                        thirty years ago. Oh Hyun-seok tries to leave the child with her, but the child refuses to let
                        him go. He decides to stay with her. When they leave, on Seo Eun-hyun’s asking, Seo Ran says he
                        wished to see Yuk Yo and Baek Ran suffer, as she was not with Seo Ran. This attitude disgusts
                        and confuses Seo Ran herself.</p>

                    <p>News of Cheongmun Ryeong’s impending death arrives. Seo Eun-hyun leaves his comrades and quickly
                        proceeds to Ascension Path. Gwak Am is waiting there. He forbids Seo Eun-hyun from entering as
                        he can see Seo Eun-hyun has yet to understand Immortal Arts further. Seo Eun-hyun attempts to
                        force his way in, but is forced to back down. Gwak Am proclaims Seo Eun-hyun will never step
                        into this place until he manages to grasp the beginning of his Immortal Art, sealing of
                        Ascension Path.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun forlornly returns to his comrades. They proceed traveling west, where they meet the
                        Azure Tiger Saint, who has also regained his memories. They talk a little about Oh Hyun-seok.
                    </p>

                    <p>98 years after falling into this world, Seo Eun-hyun returns to where Baek Ran and Kim Yeon are
                        staying. On Baek Ran’s request, Seo Eun-hyun tells her his story outside the Dream Realm. Baek
                        Ran, having regained her memories of being Buk Hyang-hwa, transmits her words to Seo Eun-hyun;
                        the world inside the Dream Realm is a world that truly exists. She tells Seo Eun-hyun to not
                        blame himself, and says the hearts of those he cares about remain with him. She says the words
                        Buk Hyang-hwa wanted to tell him were for him to forgive himself. Saying thus, she dies. Seo
                        Eun-hyun, with the pain in his heart, immediately goes to Ascension Path, declaring today Gwak
                        Am must let him in. He pierces through the seal and walks in.</p>

                    <p>As he walks, he finds himself inside the desert of his unnamed Dao Domain, with charcoal demons
                        and Tribulation Fire burning across it. He transforms into the 21 headed Ghost King, and merges
                        all the ‘instances’ into one. The Tribulation Fire melts all the sand and demons in his desert,
                        changing it to glass as rain pours down. He says while effort is important, to understand
                        Immortal Arts, one must look into their Heart. All the methods he has ever learnt condense
                        together to form his Immortal Art; Crystal Glass to Treading Sea. He enters the shrine, and pays
                        his respects to Cheongmun Ryeong’s corpse. As he bows ten times, Cheongmun Ryeong’s soul turns
                        into salt. Seo Eun-hyun notices an unbandaged Gwak Am. They are kneeling with their back to Seo
                        Eun-hyun in front of a tablet with the inscription ‘Salt Sea Supreme Deity’. Gwak Am reminds Seo
                        Eun-hyun of their promise of meeting above, revealing that they are the grave keeper of their
                        Master, Owner of Salt Mountain, and their identity as the Great Mountain Supreme Deity who
                        killed the Wuji Cult. He claims Seo Eun-hyun made his way in with the help of the
                        black-snake-bracelet given to him by Hong Fan, and expels Seo Eun-hyun and his comrades from the
                        world of Salt Mountain. As they exit the Dream Realm, Gwak Am tells Seo Eun-hyun a massive
                        misfortune awaits him and whispers a method to desecrate fate.</p>

                    <p>Kim Yeon regrets not being able to save Buk Hyang-hwa. As she is expelled from the world, Buk
                        Hyang-hwa’s soul reveals she prayed for Mad Lord’s Talent to pass onto Kim Yeon. Hers also
                        merges with the mark on Kim Yeon. Kim Yeon finds herself in a mysterious place in front of a
                        bird. The bird says for a ‘servant of death’, a price must be paid to inherit the fate she was
                        given. Kim Yeon vows to carry the misfortune in her embrace. The Bird says Kim Yeon will never
                        speak another word as long as she uses the Liberation Law Talent, until she reaches the
                        ‘Thirty-Third Heaven’.</p>

                    <p>Oh Hyun-seok’s vision fades, as he sees his adopted daughter disappearing. He gives her a China
                        Aster flower, and refrains from crying until he is out of his daughter’s sight. As he emerges,
                        he cries out, saying life is pleasure.</p>

                    <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself surrounded by his comrades and hears Oh Hyun-seok yelling. He begins
                        sending his comrades into the True Devil Realm, but Blood Yin appears, immediately killing him.
