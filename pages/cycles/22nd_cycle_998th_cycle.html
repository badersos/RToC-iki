                <p>Seo Eun-hyun opens his eyes, and is shocked to find himself in the Interdimensional Void, surrounded
                    by his comrades, in the twenty-third cycle. He once again attempts to send them into the True Devil
                    Realm, but Blood Yin kills him again. saying he cannot forgive Seo Eun-hyun for summoning light into
                    his friend. In the twenty-fourth cycle, Seo Eun-hyun sends his friends far into the Interdimensional
                    Void and holds his breath, attempting to hide from Blood Yin, but is immediately found out and
                    killed. In the twenty-fifth cycle he remembers the Great Mountain Supreme Deity’s words about
                    desecrating fate. In the twenty-sixth cycle, he cuts off an arm, creating a cursed beast he names
                    ‘Blood Yin’, declaring he has met with Blood Yin and flees. However, he is caught and killed by
                    Blood Yin again. In the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth cycles, he ponders harder on the Great
                    Mountain Supreme Diety’s words. In the twenty-ninth cycle, Seo Eun-hyun quickly enters the True
                    Devil Realm, which was once part of Blood Yin. As he celebrates his survival, Blood Yin appears on
                    the horizon and kills him. In the thirtieth cycle, Seo Eun-hyun attempts to use Extinguishing Divine
                    Tribulating Heavens, but is still killed. From the thirty-first to five hundred seventh cycles, Seo
                    Eun-hyun loses his mind and makes desperate attempts to survive, even pretending to be a Judge of
                    the Netherworld. He decides to try to breakthrough to Star Shattering to make a chance of survival
                    and repentantly enlightens himself until the 700th cycle.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>He pushes his comrades away and explodes everything, beginning the advancement ritual. He gathers his
                    consciousness around the Colourless Glass Swords, and succeeds by using the Divine Powers of
                    Integration to condense his Star body. Blood Yin arrogantly allows this. As the Star Tribulation
                    begins, Blood Yin blocks the Tribulation, which makes it gather a humongous amount of power, which
                    gathers until the barrier breaks, instantly killing Seo Eun-hyun. As he dies, he recalls a memory
                    from the 16th Cycle, of Hong Fan’s Entering Heavens Beyond the Path, which he realises is the only
                    thing that can save him.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun recalls the memory completely, and remembers the essence of the Martial Art being the
                    unification of Martial Flow. He can use Hong Fan’s Manifestation to fuse all the bolts of Star
                    Tribulation into one massive strike Blood Yin won't be able to block. He also notices the nebula of
                    the previous cycle has followed him, slightly increasing his mass. Hong Fan and Jeon Myeong-hoon
                    begin the plan, but Blood Yin kills them before they can succeed. They again use a formation to
                    force the Star Tribulation to build up. Seo Eun-hyun, enraged, explodes the newly formed star and
                    realises he needs to be able to a block a single strike of Blood Yin to successfully escape. In the
                    985th Cycle, Seo Eun-hyun finally grasps a clue. He creates the 33rd Move of Severing Mountain
                    Swordsmanship, Sumeru, but fails to properly use it. He fails and fails, but the act of drawing a
                    circle, integral to Sumeru, becomes ingrained into him.</p>

                <p>Through Sumeru, in the 991st Cycle, he succeeds in borrowing the power of the world to reach the
                    realm of a True Immortal for an instant, and dies in a mutual strike. In the 992nd Cycle, only his
                    sword crumbles. In the 994th Cycle, only Seo Eun-hyun’s energy is drained. In the 997th Cycle, Seo
                    Eun-hyun realises his technique has caused a True Immortal to Divine Descend into him. This
                    [someone] guides him into combining his Immortal and Martial techniques. Seo Eun-hyun begins to
                    ‘return to thee’, but Blood Yin is enraged at the identity of the Immortal descended and uses his
                    full force to kill Seo Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>In the 998th Cycle, Seo Eun-hyun decides to use his own strength and refuses to ‘return to thee’ to
                    the Immortal, asserting that his sword is his and his alone. Through Hong Fan’s Entering Heavens
                    Beyond the Path, Void Sword, and Jeon Myeong-hoon’s authority, all the power of the Heavenly
                    Tribulation is turned into a single strike, which Seo Eun-hyun pierces through, succeeding his
                    advancement. Seo Eun-hyun enters the Astral Realm, but is barred by the avatars of the fifty
                    Entering Nirvana True Persons that he had offended in the Nether Ghost Realm. Exhausted, Seo
                    Eun-hyun prepares to die, but the True Immortal he inadvertently Divine Descended uses his Sword
                    Dance to descend. They use Their Sword Art, Sword-Guided Star Rain, annihilating the avatars and
                    dealing a grievous wound to Blood Yin. The Immortal Introduces themselves as the Fifth of Radiance
                    Eight Immortals, Sword Spear Heavenly Lord and vows to make Seo Eun-hyun Their Immortal Treasure.
