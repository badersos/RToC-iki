            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun revels in freedom from the death loop. He places his comrades onto his true body (a
                    planet covered with swords) and forms an incarnation to talk to them. Kim Yeon is now mute due to
                    the actions of the mysterious bird. Seo Ran is suffering from headaches and memories of a certain
                    woman. Seo Eun-hyun tells them he intends to save Kang Min-hee. Suddenly, liquefied death formed due
                    to his many deaths flows out of Seo Eun-hyun’s body, and his soul begins leaving for the Underworld.
                    On Hong Fan’s advice, Seo Ran uses the Nether Crossing Ship, which summons his consciousness into
                    the inner subspace of the Nether Ghost Realm's Sacred Master Hall. The Sacred Master of the Nether
                    Ghost Realm, Yu Oh, greets them and calls Seo Eun-hyun a Heavenly King Designate. Seo Ran’s
                    consciousness is growing chaotic as the Immortal Art used by Gwak Am seems slightly weaker. Yu Oh
                    remakes the Art, which leads to Seo Ran recognising Yu Oh as immensely similar to his birth mother.
                    Yu Oh reveals her second face, saying it is possible for her other ‘identity’, formed by her
                    cultivation technique, to have children. Yu Oh implies Seo Eun-hyun and the other Enders are the
                    Seven Brilliances Heavenly Kings. Yu Oh tells Seo Eun-hyun a story of the Heavenly Kings; of falling
                    into a 'strange world', 'falling in love', 'inevitably losing that loved one', and 'through them
                    realizing one's own fate. She begins the tale of a Monster called Obsidian.</p>

                <p>Obsidian was a beast that fell into this world. It lived without a Heart. At some point it realised
                    it had no soul, and decided to find that missing part. It rose to the pinnacle of Immortal
                    Cultivation by devouring all things. At the pinnacle, it realised it still had no heart. It
                    abandoned it’s Seat and used the authority it had received upon entering this world- Reincarnation.
                    During reincarnation, it set restrictions on itself, making it such that all of its lives were spent
                    in misfortune. For 777 lifetimes, Obsidian walked on its hands chanting the Flawless Mantra. 777
                    lives later, it was overwhelmingly powerful, yet it felt it still had no heart. Obsidian went to the
                    Gods of the Wheel and the Axis for advice. The God of the Wheel to commit suicide and rest within
                    their domain. The God of the Axis told Obsidian to bring them the most precious thing in the Three
                    Thousand Great Thousand Worlds. After many years Obsidian determined its body and authority was the
                    most precious thing and began carving it off. As it had finished, it was offered milk porridge by a
                    girl- and for the first time it felt taste. He followed the girl, blessing her. After spending much
                    time with the girl, Obsidian realised the most precious thing did not exist. He regenerated his
                    lower half and consummated his relationship with the girl, whom he had fallen in love with. Obsidian
                    left to gather the fragments of his body to make his wife a god, but found her dead on his return.
                    He wept bitterly, realising the missing part of his soul was desire. He wished to return to his
                    home, the land of undyings, where his wife could not have died. He activated an Immortal Art to
                    swallow all Phenomenon and sought out an “ominous place”, felled its gatekeeper, and went beyond.
                </p>

                <p>Yu Oh ends the story and compares it to the four conditions she mentioned before. Seo Eun-hyun asks
                    if all the Heavenly Rejected are known as Heavenly Kings. Yu Oh denies such and says they must go
                    through the four points of development and know their fate, and also reach the pinnacle of True
                    Immortality. Those Heavenly Rejected bearing such a title can be on the level of Heavenly
                    Venerables. Suddenly, Seo Eun-hyun realises he has felt no [shock] upon learning of such
                    individuals. Yu Oh says the wisdom of these names is kept locked by the owner. Seo Eun-hyun begins
                    thinking out loud, speculating their is something ominous in the Head Realm, but Yu Oh stops him
                    from vocalising it. She tells Seo Eun-hyun his friends are calling for him and begins sending him
                    out of her sanctum. She gives him a hint to dispersing the death energy in his soul.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun ponders on all the information received. He tells Hong Fan the formula Yu Oh gave him-
                    Taiji and Three Ultimates. Seo Eun-hyun inserts the Yin and Yang of his Heaven and Earth cultivation
                    (colourless), and the black of his Void Shattering. This absorbs the death energy temporarily,
                    before dying out. As the Death Three Great Ultimates rotate, Seo Eun-hyun sees into the Flower Field
                    through a newly acquired sense he realised through dying and seeing the light of birth. The old man
                    gives him an annihilation flower and disappears.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun worries about the sudden gift. He turns to his comrades and tells them about Enders and
                    the condition of “gifts” from True Immortals. He tells them to ascend, leaving Seo Ran and Hong Fan
                    with him, claiming they are more of hindrances due to his current cultivation level. As they leave,
                    Kim Young-hoon tells Seo Eun-hyun to look at his intent. Seo Eun-hyun does so and realises ripping
                    death from his soul causes his intent to rapidly change into attraction force, making him
                    emotionless.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun arrives at Peaceful Cloud Continent to ask Ham Jin for the jade. Ham Jin has been
                    leading a life of debauchery as the single most powerful cultivator on the continent. Displeased,
                    Seo Eun-hyun inflicts wisdom onto him, and forbids him from appearing in front of Seo Eun-hyun ever
                    again.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun arrives on a star and muses about the creation of this path. The star tells him the path
                    was made on the Lofty Dragon’s instructions. It turns out to be a True Person of the Human Race,
                    Lofty Dragon Care Chief Priest, Jinlu Gok. Jinlu Gok states he can feel the two required Immortal
                    Arts, Purple Soul Filling the Heavens and Salt Sea Returning Dew Jade, for the Path to activate from
                    Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun recognises him as the one who left a diary in Lofty Dragon’s scroll.</p>

                <p>Jinlu Gok offers to help Seo Eun-hyun with his unstable mental state. He tells Seo Eun-hyun those
                    with Manifestations have their intent turn into attraction force even more rapidly then those
                    without, as he himself experienced, being Third Manifestation. Seo Eun-hyun asks him if there is a
                    way to reverse this. Jinlu Gok asks why Seo Eun-hyun wished to do so. He wonders why he wants to
                    become stronger, why he wants to protect his comrades, or return to his homeland, prompted by a
                    spell cast by Jinlu Gok. The [blessing] asks Seo Eun-hyun what is the point of life. Realising there
                    is no point to emotions for him now, he decides to die- but to die he must sever regression, his
                    original goal. Laughing crazily, Seo Eun-hyun reabsorbs the death energy he cast out. He uses the
                    Phenomenon Extinguishing Mantra to compress the death energy, and then spreads it out. He is once
                    again harassed by Sword Spear Heavenly Lord, who bites down on his shoulder, leaving Their mark.
                    Jinlu Gok is miffed by Seo Eun-hyun’s connections to multiple True Immortals, and chases him away.
                    At Seo Eun-hyun’s last question, he tells him the Path of Stars was made to exit the Sun and Moon
                    Heavenly Domain, but was blocked off by Yang Su-jin.</p>

                <p>Several days later, Seo Eun-hyun arrives at the Sacred Lightning Sea. He enters and finds himself in
                    world of black clouds and golden lightning, where he uses Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens.
                    He is struck by a bolt of prismatic lightning and faints. Upon awakening, he realises he has
                    inadvertently possessed Jeon Myeong-hoon. Due to being in the Lightning Sacred Sea and possesses
                    Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens, Seo Eun-hyun can now freely possess any disciple of the
                    Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect. He goes to visit Baek Woon and apologises for his actions. She
                    asks him to let her strike him once. After the strike, she recognises him and lets him be. Yeon Wei
                    sees Seo Eun-hyun in Jeon Myeong-hoon’s body and asks for a private meeting.</p>

                <p>Yeon Wei has mistaken him for a True Immortal and begs him to protect the Golden Divine Heavenly
                    Thunder Sect. Seo Eun-hyun tells her he is not a True Immortal, but as he aims to become one, he
                    will protect the sect. As he prepares to return to the Lightning Sacred Sea, he communicates with
                    Jeon Myeong-hoon, who so far was unable to respond within his body. Jeon Myeong-hoon says it is
                    impossible for anyone to treat him as “the human Seo Eun-hyun”, because he takes too much
                    responsibility upon himself. Because of this, he no longer cares about the opinions of others. Jeon
                    Myeong-hoon asks Seo Eun-hyun to trust his comrades a little more. Seo Eun-hyun’s consciousness
                    returns to the Lightning Sacred Sea.</p>

                <p>A massive hummingbird appears in front of him and leads him to a pagoda. She transforms into a human
                    girl with platinum blonde hair. The girl introduces herself as the attendant concubine and pet of
                    the Golden Divine, Immortal Beast Golden Shaking Bird. She calls him Young Master and tells him he
                    must pass through the Lightning Sacred Sea to procure the [Symbols of the Five Middle Realms]. She
                    also says it is impossible to shift the living beings of the Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain elsewhere
                    as only those who have mastered the Red Lighting Heavenly Tribulation or Extinguishing Divine
                    Tribulating Heavens to pass through. She also cannot open the treasure vault as the only way in is
                    to pass the trials. She shoves him into a pond which is the gateway to the Tower.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself in a tower. The floors up to the ninety-fifth floor have already been
                    cleared by the expedition team. Here, Seo Eun-hyun faces the Esteemed Ones of the Middle REalms and
                    offers his greetings. A Tall Tree Race Esteemed One is irked by his presence as he ‘molested’ Baek
                    Woon. The Bright Cold Realm Esteemed Ones convince the others to fight as well. The Nether Ghost
                    Realm Esteemed Ones have, meanwhile, fled before Seo Eun-hyun’s appearance. Jang Ik says he will
                    fight Seo Eun-hyun after a nap, and tells the others to do as they see fit.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>A total of twenty Esteemed Ones surround Seo Eun-hyun. He fights all twenty on equal terms, tossing
                    them around. With only Five Esteemed Ones remaining, the Tall Tree Race, Slaughtering Heaven
                    Esteemed One, Geuk Gwang summons the Sword Spear Heavenly Lord. It looks at Seo Eun-hyun and once
                    again voices Its desire for him. It then goes on say it wished to break everything he has. Seo
                    Eun-hyun firmly says this is not possible as everything is dear to him. The figure calls Seo
                    Eun-hyun arrogant, yet claims to wish to see his sword surpass Its. Seo Eun-hyun realises It has
                    given a divine power as a gift and decisively breaks it, much to Guek Gwang’s despair. The Fight
                    continues. Seo Eun-hyun gives his respect to the Land and Will Dual Cultivator Esteemed One of the
                    Horned Ox Race, Ham Rak. Ham Rak has reached Third Manifestation. During their conversation Seo
                    Eun-hyun mentions Three Flowers Wuji despite never having used the term before. As the fight comes
                    to an end, Seo Eun-hyun nearly dies from Opening Heaven Esteemed One Wol-jin’s bloodline technique.
                    However, the strike exhausts Wol-jin, the only one still on his feet.</p>

                <p>The battle ends with Seo Eun-hyun’s victory. The other Esteemed Ones give respect to Seo Eun-hyun,
                    also because he can produce Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy despite having only one star. Seo
                    Eun-hyun tells the Esteemed Ones about Golden Shaking Bird, and asks leave to fight Jang Ik. He
                    knocks on the barrier Jang Ik made when his head is suddenly cut off.</p>

                <p>The master of the 99th floor, a large Thunder Bee, makes off with Seo Eun-hyun’s head. He sees Jang
                    Ik fighting off hundreds of Thunder Bees, and his head is carried into the hive. As the Thunder Bee,
                    who claims to be Golden Shaking Bird’s daughter, sets him down, Seo Eun-hyun finds his consciousness
                    pulled into another space. Gyu Wol-jin tells Seo Eun-hyun Golden Shaking Bird is a malicious
                    creature and to beware. Jang Ik and Seo Eun-hyun embed their own Manifestations within each other
                    and begin pulling the latetr down when Golden Shaking Bird interferes. She takes Seo Eun-hyun to the
                    Great Desolate Path, which was Yang Su-jin’s emergency escape and the control centre of the Tower of
                    Trials. Golden Shaking Bird tells Seo Eun-hyun she is the collective consciousness of the Thunder
                    Bird Golden Shaking Sect, which followed Yang Su-jin faithfully only to be annihilated by his hand.
                    She was bound to the Tower of Trials by Yang Su-jin's death, ground down until she dies. She plans
                    to force the position of Tower Master onto her master’s successor and find his original world,
                    becoming his true wife. Seo Eun-hyun suddenly starts yelling about his shoulder. Golden Shaking Bird
                    is suddenly distracted and Seo Eun-hyun unleashes Sumeru.</p>

                <p>Down in the 98th floor, Baek Woon summons herself from the Sword Scar on Seo Eun-hyun’s shoulder, and
                    breaks into the 100th floor, where Seo Eun-hyun’s use of Sumeru has failed. Baek Woon prays to the
                    Seventh Seat of the Radiance Eight Immortals, Great Sea Heavenly Lord. Their power freezes the Tower
                    of Trials. Golden Shaking Bird hides within Seo Eun-hyun’s Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens,
                    and when Baek Woon enters the 101st floor, attempts to summon Jeon Myeong-hoon through the sword
                    scar. Overjoyed, Golden Shaking Bird gains full control over the Lighting Sacred Sea and expels all
                    the Esteemed Ones along with Baek Woon.</p>

                <p>Baek Woon states there is now no point in invading the Lighting Sacred Sea, and they must find a way
                    to survive The End. She says they will construct a [space] where only Esteemed Ones and above can
                    survive. Seo Eun-hyun asks if there is a way lower lifeforms can survive, but Baek Woon says it is
                    not possible. The other Esteemed Ones tell Seo Eun-hyun they must hurry back as they cannot use the
                    Path of the Stars, considering Yin Ghost Esteemed One was suddenly possessed and had to be killed to
                    prevent them from destroying the Path of Stars. Seo Eun-hyun uses his Star Shattering cultivation to
                    peek into Jang Ik’s battle with the Yin Ghost Esteemed One. He sees Jang Ik bitterly fighting
                    against the Transformation form of the Yin Ghost Esteemed One. The Yin Ghost Esteemed One challenges
                    Jang Ik to approach and kill them, whilst they lament the existence of Reincarnation. The Yin Ghost
                    Esteemed One swallows the key to the Path of Stars and dies over the teleportation formation. As Seo
                    Eun-hyun attempts to release the sense of the Earth Tribe, the Yin Ghost Esteemed One’s body
                    vanishes, leaving a form incredibly similar to Hyeon Gwi of the Black Scaled Fish Commanding Sect.
                    Hyeon Gwi feels like a complete Void to Seo Eun-hyun’s senses. Seo Eun-hyun realises this being can
                    kill him and joyfully asks for death.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "You, you can kill me, can't you!? Right!? Go on, kill me! I'm telling you to kill me right here and
                    now!"<br>
                    —Seo Eun-hyun
                </blockquote>

                <p>Hyeon Gwi takes on the appearance of a young girl clad in a martial arts robe and shows Seo Eun-hyun
                    the ultimate of Martial Arts. Through this, Seo Eun-hyun realises the fragment of Martial Extreme is
                    nothingness, and martial arts are meaningless. Because of this, he finds himself unable to use
                    Martial Arts. Seo Eun-hyun gives the Esteemed Ones the key to the Path of the Stars, and asks for
                    some time alone. Seo Eun-hyun asks Star Seeking Esteemed One Yo Un to look after Hong Yeon and Su
                    In. The Esteemed Ones comfort Seo Eun-hyun and leave him be. Seo Eun-hyun calls Seo Hweol out of his
                    shadow. Seo Hweol is now inhabiting Hyeon Eum’s body, and using the multiple information stars
                    comprising his body to subtly influence the Esteemed Ones. Seo Hweol says he does not have any
                    negative intentions towards Seo Eun-hyun, as Seo Eun-hyun stands like a shield in front of him,
                    confusing Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Hweol offers to help Seo Eun-hyun with two of his comrades, Jeon
                    Myeong-hoon and Kang Min-hee. He only needs Seo Eun-hyun to go past the 108th Floor of the Tower of
                    Trials. Reluctantly, Seo Eun-hyun agrees.</p>

                <p>Seo Hweol begins brainwashing all the Thunder Beasts in the Tower of Trials, with the help of Seo
                    Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun is forced to call for Zhengli in order to distract Golden Shaking Bird.
                    Zhengli makes a prophecy for Heavenly Punishment’s descent in Jeon Myeong-hoon and leaves.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun flees Golden Shaking Bird’s rage through the Path of Stars. Seo Hweol tells Seo Eun-hyun
                    it will ten thousand years to rescue Jeon Myeong-hoon, and Seo Eun-hyun reluctantly decides to wait.
                    At Peaceful Cloud Realm, Seo Eun-hyun attempts to reenter the Bright Cold Realm through his subheart
                    sword, but Kim Young-hoon stops him as a challenge. Kim Young-hoon has also reached Void Shattering.
                    Pulling into the Bright Cold Realm, Seo Eun-hyun surrenders as he is still shaken after meeting the
                    Martial God. Kim Young-hoon brings drinks and snacks for them instead. They have a mock battle for
                    the last piece of the snack, through which Seo Eun-hyun displays his enlightenment from the Martial
                    God.</p>

                <p>Ten years later, Seo Hweol tells Seo Eun-hyun Kang Min-hee has begun her Sacred Vessel advancement,
                    and as a result, her main personality has reverted to that of a child. Seo Eun-hyun takes Seo Ran,
                    Hong Fan and sends one of his incarnations along on the Nether Crossing Ship to Mengyun Star, where
                    Kang Min-hee is. Kang Min-hee is using the Flawless Mantra as her core, and Seo Eun-hyun gives it to
                    Hong Fan to decipher. Seo Eun-hyun takes care of the child Kang Min-hee for ten years before she
                    sets out to complete her Sacred Vessel advancement, accompanied by Seo Ran and Hong Fan. Seo
                    Eun-hyun continues his own cultivation until he is told Hon Won has been killed by Yeon Wei. She
                    tells Seo Eun-hyun she revealed how Yeon Jin was a descendant of hers and Hon Won’s child, proving
                    to him ‘Cheon Ra’ never existed. Hon Won, horrified, committed suicide on Yeon Wei’s weapon. Now
                    enraged, she asks Seo Eun-hyun what he has done with Jeon Myeong-hoon, such that the record of
                    disciples at Shattered Heaven Peak reads 'fate status of being tortured until his personality
                    collapses’, and whether Seo Eun-hyun has used Jeon Myeong-hoon for a pill.</p>

                <p>Using Hon Won’s death to desecrate fate, the Great Mountain Supreme Deity escapes from their

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun exits Yeon Wei’s cell covered in bruises. He suddenly finds himself summoned to the
                    White Jade Pavilion, where Baek Woon tells them the forces of Light and the Mountain God are locked
                    in battle. During their conversation, the Great Mountain Supreme Diety shakes of the forces of
                    Light, and Baek Woon announces the Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain must prepare for destruction. Seo
                    Eun-hyun pulls all of his comrades into the White Jade Pavilion, accidentally leaving Hong Fan
                    behind. As they wait for annihilation, Ja Eum, Sacred Master of the True Devil Realm, badmouths
                    Blood Yin. As all of them await death, nothing happens. Confused, the forces of the Sun and Moon
                    Heavenly Domain return to their places.</p>

                <p>The Great Mountain Supreme Deity goes to Horse Ear Heavenly Domain and demands the Heavenly
                    Punishment Supreme Deity work with them. On the latter’s refusal, Great Mountain consumes the entire
                    Horse Ear Heavenly Domain, including Heavenly Punishment. They declare the beginning of their
                    Supreme Deity hunt.</p>

                <p>Baek Woon informs the Esteemed Ones of the Mountain God’s escape and plan to kill the owners of the
                    Heavenly Domains. The Blood Yin Realm begins it’s offensive against the True Devil Realm. Seo
                    Eun-hyun has his own problems with Them, as the part of Their prophecy stating he will face death at
                    Blood Yin’s hands has yet to be realised. Baek Woon returns Seo Eun-hyun to the Astral Realm. On his
                    return, Hong Fan informs Seo Eun-hyun he has succeeded in deciphering the Flawless Mantra. Seo
                    Eun-hyun begins practicing a simplified version of it. The darkness at the core of the Flawless
                    Mantra attempts to draw Seo Eun-hyun in, but he resists through the Phenomenon Extinguishing Mantra.
                    As a result, Seo Eun-hyun spends several years in a trance, cultivating the Flawless Mantra while
                    reciting the Phenomenon Extinguishing Mantra. Eight thousand years later, he briefly awakens and
                    forms a [Wheel] using the two mantras.</p>

                <p>During his brief awakening, Hong Fan, with the help of the others, briefly awakens Seo Eun-hyun. Seo
                    Eun-hyun notices Kim Young-hoon, Oh Hyun-seok, and Kim Yeon have all reached the level of Star
                    Shattering. Kang Min-hee is being assisted in her advancement by Seo Ran, Seo Hweol, and a split
                    soul of Blood Yin. Hong Fan pleads Seo Eun-hyun to stop cultivating the Flawless Mantra, but Seo
                    Eun-hyun says he will stake his life for those precious to him and continues.</p>

                <p>‘Seo Eun-hyun’ becomes a small being, steadily progressing from a microorganism to a multicellular
                    organism to the one who connects all of the creatures living on a strange planet made of glass.
                    Rivers of black water and flames of intense pain are found all over this planet. At some point, Seo
                    Eun-hyun is worshipped by the denizens of the planet, who call themselves Candle Dragons. As the
                    Candle Dragons cultivate, an ascender at the Earth Axis stage leaves, causing Seo Eun-hyun to
                    realise himself, connecting all seven of the Stars that make up his body as an Esteemed One. His
                    memories swiftly replay as he advances into the Sacred Vessel stage. He discovers a memory absent
                    from the Canvas of Myriad Forms and Connections, back when they were first brought into this world,
                    and witnesses the symbol of [Black Snake Biting its Tail]. Seo Eun-hyun hurriedly pushes past that
                    moment, completing his recollection of his life. He completes his Sacred Vessel advancement
                    successfully.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun is momentarily puzzled by an unheard of race rising from him. Kang Min-hee has become
                    more like a monster, losing herself as her advancement progresses. Taking Seo Ran, Seo Eun-hyun
                    pulls out Seo Hweol’s configuration from the former. Seo Hweol is now dressed in dark red, having
                    consumed Blood Yin’s clone. Seo Hweol has prevented the True Immortal that left a scar on Seo
                    Eun-hyun from pulling him into the Heavenly King Heavenly Domain. He also tells Seo Eun-hyun his
                    comrades are in the refugee space as they leave for the Lightning Sacred Sea.</p>

                <p>While on the Path of Stars, Seo Eun-hyun stops to ask Jinlu Gok about the emergence of Candle
                    Dragons. Jinlu Gok says while giving rise to living beings during the Sacred Vessel advancement is
                    not unheard of, only those species one is related to can arise. They examine Seo Eun-hyun’s Immortal
                    Beast Blood, which Seo Eun-hyun realises the regression has warped.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun and Seo Hweol arrive at the Lighting Sacred Sea, to find it covered in flames. Seo
                    Eun-hyun enters the Tower of Trials carrying Seo Ran with him.</p>

                <p>Outside, Seo Hweol, who has procured In and Yeon, and successfully brainwashed all Esteemed Ones of
                    Blood Yin, Ja Eum, Hyeon Eum, and all beings across the Astral Realm begins his plan.</p>

                    He realises the Owner of Heavenly Punishment has eroded the Tower of Trials. Seo Eun-hyun breaks
                    through towards the 108th floor. On the 106th Floor, written in English, Seo Eun-hyun finds
                    instructions on how to kill Golden Shaking Bird. On the 107th Floor, Golden Shaking Bird flees the
                    room the moment Seo Eun-hyun opens the door. Seo Eun-hyun finds Jeon Myeong-hoon possessed by a
                    being he believes is a True Immortal. Seo Eun-hyun picks up Jeon Myeong-hoon’s body and proceeds
                    through the Poppy Fragrance Labyrinth which leads to the Treasure Vault. Seo Eun-hyun collects the
                    names of Middle Realms and discovers he cannot go back. The being possessing Jeon Myeong-hoon says
                    Seo Eun-hyun can only go forward now. Seo Eun-hyun enters the 108th Floor, finding himself in the
                    basement of Yuan Li’s Black Castle. Seo Hweol, sensing this, activates Tainted Soul Filling the
                    Heavens.</p>

                <p>Seo Hweol confronts Blood Yin. Blood Yin declares Themselves Yu Hao Te, and uses the powers of the
                    Seat of Vice to judge Seo Hweol. Seo Hweol mocks Blood Yin for using Their entire power to destroy a
                    bug such as himself. He further taunts Them, playing on Their ignorance in relation to Seo Hweol,
                    who was brought out from Themselves. He releases a fragment of Ja Eum’s will, who calls him a
                    madman. Seo Hweol reveals the figure of Yu Hao Te under the Melia Tree, inside Lofty Dragon’s
                    Scroll. Blood Yin goes insane from this, and Hweol takes advantage of Ja Eum suppressing Blood Yin
                    to use Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens. He then uses Blood Yin’s weight-class to brainwash the
                    entire Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain. He then has all attraction force of the Heavenly Domain
                    converge on the Head Realm.</p>

                <p>Inside the Head Realm, Seo Eun-hyun realises Seo Hweol is about to brainwash the Head Realm. Next to
                    him, Seo Ran screams in agony as his Heavenly Circle appears behind his head. Meanwhile, Four Axes
                    appear around Seo Hweol, and he begins Heaven and Earth Unity. The being possessing Jeon Myeong-hoon
                    recommends Seo Eun-hyun kill himself as they are inside ‘its jaws’. The being states they can read
                    thoughts as they are connected to ‘electricity’. Seo Eun-hyun implores them to cure Seo Ran, but the
                    being says they cannot use such ‘ancient’ Immortal Arts, to Seo Eun-hyun’s confusion. Jeon
                    Myeong-hoon’s body scatters into the wind after an ominous warning about Light.</p>

                <p>The brainwashing waves from Seo Hweol accelerate after exiting the Serving Command Palace and travel
                    the entire Head Realm. Seo Eun-hyun attempts to use attraction force, but his instincts repeatedly
                    force him to cancel the spells. On forcing himself to use them, his consciousness leaves his control
                    and views the history of an Esteemed One of the Blood Yin Realm breaking the shrine at Ascension
                    Path, before going insane after viewing [something]. Seo Eun-hyun proceeds with his eyes closed.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun catches up to the brainwashing wave near the Sea Dragon Palace, breaking it before the
                    waves pass through. He then uses the [Wheel] he procured to force the brainwashing waves to return
                    to Seo Hweol’s origin, following the words from an unspecified being. The waves immediately pass
                    through Seo Ran, and the Head Realm turns white. Seo Ran is revealed to be Seo Hweol’s main body.
                    Seo Eun-hyun finds himself unable to stop Seo Hweol’s plan, as he cannot kill Seo Ran. As the End
                    begins, Seo Eun-hyun closes his eyes, but an old man holding a flower basket turns him into the
                    Annihilation Flower.</p>

            <h2 class="cycle-subtitle">Bugs</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Watching the process end as a flower, Seo Eun-hyun realises Seo Hweol was attempting to ‘awaken’ the
                    Head Realm. The old man says the bug has come face-to-face with something. Suddenly a ‘resplendent
                    radiance’ comes from the South.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself relaxed. He recalls Seo Hweol to be a ‘blue worm’ used in alchemy.
                    However, the Canvas of Myriad Forms and Connections pains him. The old man holding a flower basket
                    shouts to ‘remember’, which makes Seo Eun-hyun recall Seo Hweol and realise he was ‘erased’ from
                    history. He also recalls the old man is the Sal Tree Heavenly Venerable. They are joined by the
                    Great Mountain Supreme Deity, the Liberation Supreme Deity, South Polar Ritual Compass Yeong Seung
                    and the [Oldest One].</p>

                <p>Hong Fan, who had left the formation led by Baek Woon, enters the Head Realm through a hole made by
                    the Annihilation Flower. He accidentally steps on a blue worm and gently scolds it for poking its
                    head outside. Seo Eun-hyun, reduced to a single flower petal, has meanwhile been forbidden from
                    dying by the [Oldest One]. He spends years floating in the Astral Realm, successfully advances to
                    Sacred Vessel of the Earth Path, and begins experimenting with his death energy.</p>

                <p>Two hundred thousand years later, the Martial God meets Seo Eun-hyun in the form of Hyeon Gwi. She
                    asks Seo Eun-hyun to display the enlightenment he has gained as he floated around. She also says
                    Underworld always returns from the Audience Chamber. Seo Eun-hyun displays the Thirty Fourth move of
                    Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Kunlun, which Hyeon Gwi compliments before slicing her own neck.
                    Through this move, Seo Eun-hyun begins falling into the Underworld, towards the [Oldest One]. This
                    is his nine hundredth ninety ninth return.</p>
