            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself within darkness. He senses the [Wheel] that belongs to Underworld allowing
                    his death to approach, and he regresses back to when Blood Yin was attacking him. He sees the
                    [seats] in the sky go from being seven to ten, meaning regression resurrected the dead Governing
                    Immortals. From the [seats], Seo Eun-hyun senses symbols, but can only recognize the one that
                    belongs to the Great Mountain Supreme Deity.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun’s physical body is in the Integration Stage, while his cultivation realm is at the
                    Sacred Vessel stage.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun pretends to be a messenger of the Underworld in front of Blood Yin, raising his voice to
                    the True Immortal Realm. Blood Yin transforms into a human form resembling both Seo Hweol and Yu Hao
                    Te. They create a small reception chamber for Seo Eun-hyun. On Seo Eun-hyun’s orders, Blood Yin
                    destroys 2,400 of the 2,401 stars that make up Hyeon Eum, refusing to break the last one. On Seo
                    Eun-hyun’s insistence that the last one must be broken as well, Blood Yin confirms his suspicions of
                    Seo Eun-hyun not being sent by the Underworld, and Seo Eun-hyun immediately denotes his Integration
                    Stage body, beginning the advancement to Star Shattering. Seo Eun-hyun uses the [Wheel] to [rewrite]
                    Blood Yin’s first strike as he undergoes his advancement. Eventually, Seo Eun-hyun is forced to
                    compete with Blood Yin’s left arm. Seo Eun-hyun mixes together Kunlun and Sumeru to strike at Blood
                    Yin, and uses the chance to escape. He also uses the death energy of Kunlun to seal the bite mark
                    left by Sword Spear Heavenly Lord.</p>
                <p>As Seo Eun-hyun flees, his path is blocked by the fifty Entering Nirvana True Persons. Seo Eun-hyun
                    displays the [Wheel], which causes the True Persons to begin convulsing. Seo Eun-hyun mounts one of
                    them and orders them to move while threatening them with the [Wheel]. As he dismounts, Blood Yin
                    begins using an Immortal Art to judge Seo Eun-hyun’s vice. However, the judgement does not activate,
                    as Seo Eun-hyun was once a carrier of the Karmic Flame. As Seo Eun-hyun attempts to run again, he is
                    confronted by the main body of the True Person he had mounted. Seo Eun-hyun flees again, and finally
                    reaches Kang Min-hee. Seo Eun-hyun enters her body, and seizes the Heavenly Lotus Fruit inside her,
                    and declares he has ‘met’ Blood Yin, meaning the split soul inside the fruit. He then proceeds to
                    the ‘hole’ inside Kang Min-hee that leads to the Underworld. He finds Kang Min-hee in a dream, and
                    uses the [Wheel] to [rewrite] her connection, which causes the Yama True Lord and Chief Judge, Yan
                    Luo, to appear.</p>
                <p>Yan Luo pretends to be enraged and kills Seo Eun-hyun multiple times, all while teaching him how to
                    truly use the [Wheel]. He complements Seo Eun-hyun, allowing him to attempt to save Kang Min-hee,
                    and leaves. Seo Eun-hyun uses the Flawless Mantra to shrink the hole inside her and cut off the
                    connection. He then enters her dream, to see her dreaming of the day he asked her out again. Kang
                    Min-hee appears in front of him, and upon viewing her history, he sees the condition of becoming the
                    Ghost Guiding Holy Mother was a result of accepting the suffering of too many, and accepting a
                    [call] from somewhere. He holds her hand firmly and pulls her out with him, accepting all the ghosts
                    in her stead. Kang Min-hee refuses to see this and instead steps in front of him, deepening her
                    understanding of sorrow, and her hair turns blue as she purifies all the ghosts. Seo Eun-hyun also
                    fulfils the condition for advancing to Earth Sacred Vessel.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun uses the regained Three Great Ultimates fight against a True Person defeating and
                    capturing her. He is applauded by the Sacred Master of the Purple Gold Realm, Ban Ta, who offers an
                    invitation to his Ban Ta Castle. Seo Eun-hyun gives him the steles with the [symbols] for the Middle
                    Realms. He then returns to Kang Min-hee. She meets with the others. Hong Fan notices Seo Eun-hyun
                    has a new Immortal Art and confesses a feeling of nostalgia towards it.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun is greeted by the Immortal Treasures of the True Person he captured. They thank him and
                    warn him about Ban Ta desperately needing a successor. Seo Eun-hyun returns to Ban Ta, but is
                    confronted by the True Persons who are friends with the one he defeated, demanding her return. The
                    Sacred Masters of the Middle Realms step in and protect him, in exchange for the steles. Each of
                    them attempts to have Seo Eun-hyun ‘visit’ them and take on their position, and compete to see who
                    can capture Seo Eun-hyun first, throwing cultivation methods and manuals at him. Seo Eun-hyun flees
                    and enters the Path of Stars. He informs the Esteemed Ones of the return of the [symbols]. Jang Ik
                    tells Seo Eun-hyun they will fight later, as both of them know it will be a fight to the death. He
                    tells Seo Eun-hyun to trace the Fighting Spirit of Peaceful Cloud Continent before leaving.</p>

            <h2 class="cycle-subtitle">Seo Ran's Family</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun calls Seo Hweol out of his shadow. He threatens to kill Seo Ran, and coerces Seo Hweol
                    to spill his secrets. Seo Hweol agrees to help him as long as there are no questions about his part
                    or true purpose. Seo Hweol says Seo Ran is his childhood, back when Seo Hweol believed he was an
                    innocent child. He says Seo Ran is both the [pillar] of his Immortal Art, and a soul that should
                    have had his personality embedded on it, but was ‘corrupted’ by Yu Oh’s maternal emotions. Seo Hweol
                    taunts Seo Ran and calls him a monster.</p>
                <p>On Seo Hweol’s advice, Seo Eun-hyun heads to the Peaceful Cloud Realm to avoid the Sacred Masters.
                    Seo Hweol says the Peaceful Cloud Realm has a ‘consciousness’ that favourably accepts Heavenly
                    Rejected. Seo Eun-hyun becomes the Sacred Master of Peaceful Cloud, throwing the Sacred Masters into
                    a frenzy. He names his Sacred Master Palace Glass Cedarwood Mountain, and speaks the true name of
                    Peaceful Cloud- Cedarwood Painting. Ban Ta attacks once out of frustration, and during the attack,
                    Seo Eun-hyun sees the illusion of a golden monster fighting Hyeon Gwi. From this, he uses the
                    enlightenment to fend of Ban Ta’s strike. He also comes to know of the names given by the Owner of
                    the Void and the golden monster to the Steps Before the Throne. He also realises viewing this
                    enlightenment was fixed the moment he began calling his Steps “Three Flowers Wuji”. He finds himself
                    at the bottom of Cedarwood Painting and sees a Mandala describing the story of a hero who killed
                    seven monsters. Ban Ta offers Seo Eun-hyun a Dusk Talisman as an apology.</p>
                <p>Seo Ran finds himself swept up in despair about his identity. Ten years after Seo Eun-hyun became
                    Sacred Master, he tells him his plan to create a group of people and researching his Tainted Soul
                    Filling the Heavens. Seo Eun-hyun gives him the eggs for the ancestors of the Candle Dragon and
                    tells him to care for them. Seo Ran cares for them for thirty five years before they lay their eggs
                    and die, as their race will do. One year later, the first of their children is born and named Seo
                    Hye.</p>
                <p>Fifty-five years later, the entire second-generation passes away, excluding Seo Hye, who refused to
                    mate and lay eggs. Seo Hye has succeeded in making a demon method suitable for Candle Dragons and is
                    at the Core Formation Stage.</p>
                <p>Five hundred years pass. Seo Hye is now at the Heavenly Being Stage and has begun to lean towards
                    devilish methods.</p>
                <p>A thousand years pass. Seo Hye successfully reaches the Four Axis stage, and attempts to seduce Seo
                    Ran while insulting Shi Ho. She has also begun truly using devilish methods. Seo Ran was made aware
                    of the fact that Seo Hye is the split soul of Oh Hye-seo by Seo Eun-hyun on the day she was born. As
                    Seo Hye’s life parallels his own, he had decided to attempt to change her with love.</p>
                <p>Hon Won is sent to Seo Eun-hyun as a peace offering by the Human Race Alliance. He is overseen by
                    Yeon Wei. His cultivation is sealed and his death forbidden. Yeon Wei, meanwhile, considers Seo
                    Eun-hyun a True Immortal watching her and Hon Won struggle for entertainment.</p>
                <p>Shi Ho is enraged at Seo Hye’s blatant devilish activities and Sacred Master Seo Eun-hyun’s apathy
                    towards her. He tries to convince her to stop, but Seo Hye brushes him off. Her memories as Oh
                    Hye-seo have begun returning, and she fights and defeats Shi Ho, who flees. Seo Ran appears, and Oh
                    Hye-seo infects him to make Seo Hweol take his true body. However, Seo Ran simply dies, and the
                    infection fails. It is revealed Oh Hye-seo’s split soul only infected Seo Hye within Seo Eun-hyun’s
                    internal world, the Colourless Sword Enclosure.</p>

                    help, but receives none. The True Persons of the Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain surround Cedarwood
                    Painting and demand he stop his chant. The Sacred Master also join in. Seo Eun-hyun tells them he
                    plans to save everyone, fuses Cedarwood Painting with the Lofty Dragon’s Scroll, and claims the
                    Clear Scale Armour, and releases Karmic Fire. With this, he declares the beginning to the Artificial

                <p>The Sacred Masters excluding Yu Oh continue to fight Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun uses the authorities
                    of his comrades to continue building up the Artificial Middle Realm by absorbing Decaying Corpse
                    Realms. He borrows the power of the Owner of Heavenly Punishment and uses Seo Hweol to erode the
                    Middle Realms. At the same time, the Mandala of Cedarwood accelerates his cultivation the more
                    desperately he fights. He enters Seo Hweol’s essence and begins tracing his history, which will take
                    six thousand years.</p>
                <p>Four thousand years later, through Seo Hweol, the Chaos Realms of the Bright Cold Realm, True Devil
                    Realm, Ancient Force Realm, and Purple Gold Realm become part of Cedarwood Painting. Seo Eun-hyun
                    begins advancing his Earth cultivation to Entering Nirvana in secret, splitting into three clones of
                    Heaven, Earth and Heart. Seo Hweol notices almost immediately and proceeds with his own plans. Hweol
                    briefly touches upon the power of Bright Cold emitted by Kim Yeon and hits upon a genius plan that
                    requires a desperate gamble.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Yeon Wei is to die in seven years. Seo Hweol comes and prays for her sincerely, which
                    causes a severe backlash to Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens. Seo Ran understands the weakness of
                    Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens as he too prays for Yeon Wei. He solidifies his identity as Seo
                    Ran, which also solidifies the identity of Seo Hye. Meanwhile, Seo Hweol has tracked down Yuan Li’s
                    blood body, and contacts Oh Hye-seo, who wanders Seo Eun-hyun’s internal world. Inside Yeon Wei, Seo
                    Hweols’ and Seo Ran’s sincere hearts reside, bringing them in contact. Seo Hweol plans to bring Yeon
                    Jin to Yeon Wei and kill him, amplifying her emotions. During the retrieval, Yeon Jin inadvertently
                    mentions Hong Yeon and Su In. Seo Hweol extracts the location from Yeon Jin.</p>
                <p>Yeon Wei finds Seo Hweol in her room. He pulls out the head of Hong Yeon and implants the soul into
                    Yeon Wei, after which she begins to call for Hon Won. With Hon Won, he implants Su In’s soul, and he
                    begins calling for Cheon Ra.</p>

                <p>Seo Hweol uses the attraction force generated to appear inside the Colourless Sword Enclosure, next
                    to Oh Hye-seo, and his clones arrive holding onto Yeon Wei, Hon Won and Seo Ran. Seo Hweol enters
                    Seo Ran, and Seo Eun-hyun appears inside moments later. Seo Eun-hyun cuts through the barrier Oh
                    Hye-seo has made using the power of the Owner of Names, also known as the God of Humans. Seo
                    Eun-hyun is allowing Seo Hweol and Seo Ran to fight for their identity on Seo Ran’s request.</p>
                <p>Inside the essence of Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens, Seo Ran tells Seo Hweol he is real as he has
                    been loved. Seo Hweol, with the help of Oh Hye-seo, summons Shi Ho into their essence and begins
                    torturing him, taunting Seo Ran and saying Shi Ho merely fell in love with Tainted Soul Filling the
                    Heavens. Seo Ran says he never wished to have such a partner, and hence, Tainted Soul Filling the
                    Heavens does not enter the picture for Shi Ho’s love. He lists incidents from the past that prove
                    benevolence stands above Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens. Seo Hweol covers both of them in his
                    childhood.</p>
                <p>Shi Ho recovers his senses to find both Seo Hweol and Seo Ran dyed in a dark-red light. He meets Seo
                    Ran’s anguished eyes and tells him not to forget Shi Ho as Seo Hweol rips the fox apart. Because of
                    this, Seo Ran loses, and is consumed by Seo Hweol. As he is consumed, Seo Ran tells Seo Hweol his
                    heart will never disappear. As such, Seo Ran’s [name] is stripped away, and Seo Hweol cannot recall
                    it.</p>
                <p>As Seo Hweol fuses with ■■, the emotion of hate fills him. Seo Hweol flees with Oh Hye-seo, while Seo
                    Eun-hyun begins to chase. He realises Seo Eun-hyun can track him as ■■ sent their memories to him.
                    Seo Hweol’s past unfolds before Seo Eun-hyun’s eyes.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol lived a series of lives, reincarnating with their memories intact. However, each time, the
                    causality that caused the birth of the previous life would disappear, and they would be inflicted by
                    a sense of déjà vu. They began using drugs to recall the feeling, even using their power as an
                    Empress. They discovered ‘loathing’ at the centre of the déjà vu, which was the hatred of those he
                    had ‘replaced’. They also discovered their world was merely a dream.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol brainwashed the entire world in their 8th life, replacing everyone, but was still unable to
                    exit the dream. They realised they must discover their essence to exit, and eventually reached the
                    fact that they were a part of a secret art called Purple Soul Filling the Heavens that had mixed
                    with other things to become something new. In despair, they commit suicide, but find themselves
                    repeating another life. They also realise a living being reaches the extreme of emotions upon death,
                    and that Seo Hweol themselves was just another [character] in the dream. They collapse from the
                    pain, and fragment themselves with the resolve to escape.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Upon their exit, they meet the Administrator of the world. The administrator tells Seo Hweol this
                    world was merely a training ground for someone else, and introduces itself as ‘Agate’. Agate sends
                    Seo Hweol back into the dream, but they break it once again, replace the Purple Soul Filling the
                    Heavens inhabiting the dream with themselves and devoured Agate.</p>
                <p>And thus was Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens born.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol’s consciousness tracked down his origin, found the origin of everything, and committed
                    suicide. His consciousness is pulled back by [someone under a white wheel].</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol regains consciousness in the body of a baby Sea Dragon experimented upon by the Yuan Clan.
                    The Yuan clan previously worshipped Golden Divine Yang Su-jin before being granted the power of
                    Blood Yin. They vow to find the someone who pulled him back. They swore to read the Akashic Records
                    and find their origin.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol took over the Yuan Clan and destroyed them. He then approached the Sea Dragon Race and
                    eventually was enthroned as the Sea Dragon King. He solidified his identity as [Sea Dragon male with
                    a gentle smile] with the purpose of overturning his lineage from Ja Eum and Blood Yin. Seo Hweol
                    hunted down the remnants of the Yuan Clan, which was soon replaced by the Jo Clan. He discovered the
                    connection the laboratory under the Black Castle had to the Lighting Sacred Sea. He discovered what
                    was sealed in Ascension Path, inadvertently led to the birth of the Mad Lord and the destruction of
                    the Jo Clan, and tracked down the [Extraordinary Pattern Law Talent] to the Serving Command Palace.
                    When he was chased to the Serving Command Palace by the Mad Lord, he discovered the Head Realm was
                    actually alive. He learnt the term [Non-Human] from texts left behind by the Golden Divine Yang
                    Su-jin.</p>
                <p>This realisation lead to Seo Hweol becoming more ruthless. He infected everyone in the Head Realm but
                    left their personalities intact to avoid alerting any True Immortals. He created three Sea Dragon
                    Astronomers, his direct descedants, Seo Yun and Seo Heon, and another named Jeon Hyang. However, Seo
                    Yun's personality was sucked into the sky, which led to Seo Hweol decreasing the already diluted
                    Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens within the astronomers and taking over Seo Yun's body. Seo Heon,
                    Seo Yun's son, insisted on becoming a Sea Dragon Warrior and left the astronomy. Around this time, a
                    fragment of Yu Oh, whom Seo Hweol recognised as the Sacred Master of the Nether Ghost Realm,
                    descended into the Head Realm. He attempted to erode her through Seo Heon, but at some point Tainted
                    Soul Filling the Heavens was unable to affect her.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol pushed both Seo Heon and Yu Oh to their deaths, and attempted to make their unborn child
                    his main body, but the connection between him and the main body distorted, and was named Seo Ran.
                    Seo Hweol tried to have Seo Ran commit suicide, but the last surviving astronomer, Jeon Hyang, cared
                    for him. Jeon Hyang had meanwhile gone mad, and was convinced Seo Hweol was killing off the
                    astronomers despite the fact she had been the only one for a long time. Seo Hweol killed her on the
                    day of ascension, before her madness could get out of hand, and left Tainted Soul Filling the
                    Heavens behind, in case of emergencies.</p>
                <p>After this he proceeds to Ascension Path.</p>
                <p>After reading Seo Hweol’s history, Seo Eun-hyun begins his master plan.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol has regained his sight, using his [eyes] to distort the attraction force between Yeon Wei
                    and Hon Won, forcing them to cycle endlessly. The End accelerates even further. Through the
                    acceleration he has caused, Seo Hweol intends to dye the entire Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain with
                    Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens. He suddenly notices a mist spread out throughout the Heavenly
                    Domain; this is Seo Eun-hyun’s Filling the Heavens Governing View, which has led Seo Hweol into
                    committing himself to a mad gamble.</p>
                <p>Martial Artist Seo Eun-hyun launches himself to Seo Hweol, and releases the Thirty-Fifth Move of
                    Severing Mountain Swordsmanship, Cedarwood. Seo Hweol is bewildered by the fact he can feel [pain].
                    Through Cedarwood, Seo Eun-hyun has embedded the Heart of various Heart Tribe Members. While Seo
                    Eun-hyun is happily beating Seo Hweol, the latter sends away Oh Hye-seo along with Hon Won and Yeon
                    Wei. Meanwhile, Earth Tribe Seo Eun-hyun finishes the Advancement to Entering Nirvana.</p>
                <p>Oh Hye-seo reaches the spot where her reserve body was kept, only to finds Seo Hye there. Seo Hye has
                    destroyed the reserve body. She uses techniques that appear devilish, and were prepared by Seo
                    Eun-hyun and his comrades. Oh Hye-seo defeats Seo Hye and reclaims her original body.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun activates Filling the Heavens Governing View, Yeon’s Play, and Mad Lord’s Heart of Love.
                    He declares Hon Won’s and Yeon Wei’s fate of misfortune to be fulfilled, causing a contradiction and
                    shattering the star of prophecy. Seo Hweol desperately tries to awaken the Head Realm. Hon Won frees
                    himself, and has regained his cultivation. He defeats Oh Hye-seo, and goes to Yeon Wei. They die
                    together in the flames of the palace partially destroyed by Hon Won’s Great Mountain Splitting
                    Emperor Technique.</p>

                    rewrites history to such that Seo Hweol never caught them. Their souls combine into one, and the
                    lingering will of the Vast Cold Heavenly Lord appears for a moment.</p>
                <p>Jang Ik appears to fight Seo Eun-hyun. Seo Eun-hyun projects the Final Decisive Move of Severing
                    Mountain Swordsmanship, which is as-of-yet incomplete. Jang Ik’s move, prepared to cut down the End,
                    blasts forth. Seo Eun-hyun is forced to use the Great Mountain Spliting Emperor Technique to defend
                    himself, which fatally wounds Jang Ik. Jang Ik shows his Heart Field and tells Seo Eun-hyun he could
                    not bring himself to proceed to the Third Step Before the Throne, as it would require him to
                    practice either Heaven or Earth Cultivation and understand their hearts. He asks Seo Eun-hyun to
                    promise him to create a world where the strong may not oppress the weak.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun steps out of Cedarwood Painting, and declares the End has already happened, deferring it
                    for an unspecified amount of time.</p>

                    him to Entering Nirvana in Heaven as well, and completes Crystal Glass to Treading Sea. He twists
                    history so Seo Hweol can see his own heart. Shi Ho returns to life and calls for ■■. Shi Ho refuses
                    the chance at resurrection and merely calls out ■■’s name as he dies once again. Seo Ran’s heart
                    stops Seo Hweol from piercing the Head Realm’s forehead. The faint glimmer of hope Seo Hweol holds
                    of his first parents being real stands against Seo Eun-hyun and Seo Ran, and attempts to force
                    himself through, but is stopped by Hong Fan, who volunteered for the job. Just as Seo Eun-hyun is
                    about seize Seo Hweol, Oh Hye-seo snatches him away.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun begins to chase them, but time is frozen by South Polar Ritual Treasure, Yeong Seung. He

                    desire to live. Seo Eun-hyun’s clone arrives on the star, but mourns Yeon Wei and Hon Won as he is
                    confident there is no escape route. Seo Hweol is despairing as the Akashic Record judges Seo Hweol’s
                    origin from who gave him a heart, and discovered that there was no one. It was ■■ who had this, and
                    Hweol acknowledges his identity as ■■. Seo Hweol asks Oh Hye-seo what is the meaning of life, to
                    which she says she has no idea, but is looking for it with him as a clue. Seo Hweol realises he can
                    attempt to take Oh Hye-seo’s body as she appears to love him. Before he can ask her for this, she
                    asks to see his true face. After he shows her the pain inside Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens, she
                    kisses him. Seo Hweol loses control of himself and begins hurling curses at her while acknowledging
                    that she is her origin, and gives everything of his to her, as he had vowed. Nothing remains of him
                    but his bones. Oh Hye-seo hurriedly escapes, deluding herself of Seo Hweol being alive still.</p>
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun’s clone discovers Seo Hweol’s leftover when he arrives at the star. He discovers Seo
                    Hweol has accepted and merged with Seo Ran. The leftover erases its personality to prevent Seo
                    Eun-hyun from pulling out any answers. Seo Eun-hyun bids his fellow Daoist farewell and his clone
                    leaves.</p>

            <h2 class="cycle-subtitle">Vast Cold's Descendant</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>The projections of the Northern Dipper Seven Heavenly Lords tell Seo Eun-hyun they must destroy every
                    living being in the Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain in order to restore the proper time frame to all
                    the Heavenly Domains. Seo Eun-hyun begins a battle with the seven Northern Dipper Seven Heavenly
                    Lords. Seo Eun-hyun fights on the verge of a loss the entire fight, until Blood Yin send him advice,
                    telling him to use the [Wheel]. The [Wheel] amplifies his powers explosively, putting him on the
                    level of Vast Cold when They were a True Person. As Seo Eun-hyun thanks Blood Yin, calling him Yu
                    Hao Te, They tell Seo Eun-hyun to call them Blood Yin when they carry the [Wheel]. The fight goes
                    on, and Seo Eun-hyun is struck by one of seven Northern Dipper Sealing Immortal Flags everytime he
                    kills a projection. He is eventually stuck by all seven, which Seo Eun-hyun resists. Blood Yin
                    approaches Seo Eun-hyun, Ja Eum in hand, and demands Seo Eun-hyun prove he is worthy of the [Wheel].
                </p>
                <p>Blood Yin reveals his True Form as a skull devoid of flesh, and creates a star of prophecy that
                    states Seo Eun-hyun will enter his mouth, get crushed, and perish. With the prophecy, Blood Yin adds
                    two choices; Seo Eun-hyun breaks the star and becomes a “a fearless warrior who knows no retreat”,
                    or flee and become “nothing but a cowardly, pathetic weakling who knows only defeat, living the rest
                    of your life trapped in a cave until you finally take your own life”. Seo Eun-hyun naturally chooses
                    to fight, and Fate erases the possibility of retreat. The fight continues, and Blood Yin teaches Seo
                    Eun-hyun how True Immortals fight. Seo Eun-hyun’s comrades join the fight.</p>
                <p>Kim Yeon watches Seo Eun-hyun and knows he cannot win. A voice comes to her from Seo Eun-hyun,
                    telling her to believe in herself. Hong Fan assist her in her attempt to reach Seo Eun-hyun. The
                    bird-shaped seal momentarily lifts, and she tells Seo Eun-hyun she likes him. He accepts her feeling
                    this time, and the realisation that life is love bursts from her lips as the seal settles back in
                    place. Meanwhile, Great Sun Heavenly Lord, Third Seat of the Radiance Eight Immortals descends to
                    kill Seo Eun-hyun.</p>
                <p>Blood Yin momentarily resists the authority of the Great Sun Heavenly Lord, makes a hole in the
                    Heavenly Domain, and scatters all the Enders except Seo Eun-hyun as he self-destructs, and pushes
                    Seo Eun-hyun into his True Immortal advancement ritual. With this, the former Chief Judge of the
                    Netherworld, Nether Devil True Lord Yu Hao Te falls into complete slumber.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun, as he dies, sees the Great Sun Heavenly Lord attempt to pull him back into his physical
                    body. He cannot return to life as that would mean torture in Radiance Hall, and both the Eastern
                    Flower Field and Underworld are covered by the will of the [Oldest One]. Seo Eun-hyun decides to
                    enter the Domain of Purity, as either dying forever or ascending to True Immortal are acceptable to
                    him.</p>
                <p>This is his 1000th return.</p>
