                Seo Eun-hyun and his colleagues are transmigrated into another world. Out of his six colleagues, five
                are snapped up by cultivation sects. His only companion, Kim Young-hoon, becomes the number one martial

                in everything, he remained a soap seller. His soap recipe was stolen by bandits, which caused his
                business to fail. Fifty years after falling into this world, he dies as a old man.

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun finds himself back at the time they fell into the world. He leads his colleagues into a
                    cave. When a large, white fox claiming to be the "Master of the Forest" demands a limb from one of
                    them in exchange for safe passage in the forest, Seo Eun-hyun offers his arm. Jeon Myeong-hoon plots
                    to have Seo Eun-hyun offer his limbs again when the fox returns.</p>

                <p>When the snake demanding blood appears, Seo Eun-hyun coerces Myeong-hoon to offer his blood. Three
                    days later, three Heavenly Being Cultivators appear. They take Jeon Myeong-hoon, Kang Min-hee and Oh
                    Hyun-seok, as they posses special qualities. Later that day, Oh Hye-seo shows abnormal reactions.
                    The Sea Dragon King appears. He introduces himself, and tells the group they are in Ascension Path.
                    He tells them many strong cultivators are on the island, and warns Seo Eun-hyun against talking to
                    them. Kim Yeon awakens a strange power that calls the Mad Lord towards them. The Mad Lord throws Seo
                    Eun-hyun and Kim Young-hoon into a rift, teleporting them to Yanguo.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun sticks close to Kim Young-hoon, who was the strongest martial artist in the world in the
                    first cycle. They join sects where Kim Young-hoon's talent for martial arts sprouts . Due to his
                    incompetent nature, Seo Eun-hyun becomes a doctor. Kim Young-hoon created the Wulin Alliance and
                    appointed Seo Eun-hyun as its Chief Strategist. He also created Severing Mountain Swordsmanship for
                    Seo Eun-hyun After retiring, Kim Young-hoon starts duelling cultivators. After learning his
                    weaknesses, Kim Young-hoon decides to become a cultivator and disappears after giving Seo Eun-hyun a
                    record of his insights from his fights against the cultivators, titled Record of Transcending
                    Cultivation and Extreme Martial Arts. Seo Eun-hyun died waiting for Kim Young-hoon to return.</p>

                <p>Kim Young-hoon and Seo Eun-hyun decide to challenge sects to gauge their strength. After taking down
                    many sects, Kim Young-hoon establishes a martial faction, the Palace Of Martial Extremity. The
                    Palace refuses to bow to cultivators, and goes to war against them. After defeating cultivators, the
                    Palace is deemed illegal and is renamed to the Palace Of Demons. Kim Young-hoon is given the
                    nickname Extreme Demon. Ten years later, it is renamed again to Palace Of Heavenly Demons. Kim
                    Young-hoon's title evolves to Extreme Heavenly Demon. When the Palace eventually settles down in one
                    place, fifty Qi Building Cultivators attack them. Almost all the martial artist die. Kim Young-hoon
                    himself escapes, while the cultivators pursue him. Seo Eun-hyun establishes Gwiyeonggak, an
                    intelligence organization. He manipulates and collects information while practising the sword to the
                    end. Kim Young-hoon appears once more and adds 12 new forms to Severing Mountain Swordmanship, also
                    leaving behind Record of Gazing Cultivation and Exceeding Martial Arts. Seo Eun-hyun dies practicing

                    him martial arts. They promise to meet every two years. Seo Eun-hyun goes around Yanguo and
                    challenges various righteous and unorthodox sects. Kim Young-hoon establishes the Wulin Alliance
                    once more, but Seo Eun-hyun rejects his offer of joining the Alliance. Throughout the years, Seo
                    Eun-hyun challenges a sect, defeats it, and eat noodles before going on to the next sect. He is
                    given the title, Infinite Fighting Spirit. Thus later changed to Infinite Fighting Madman and then
                    to Infinite Fighting Monster. During this time, Kim Young-hoon retires from his duties and

                <p>10 years after Kim Young-hoon's disappearence, he greets Seo Eun-hyun at a noodle-shop. Kim

                    five years, when Kim Young-hoon gives him tips to reach the Pinnacle Realm, and adds to the Record.
                    Thirty five years into the cycle, as Seo Eun-hyun was practicing swordsmanship, Kim Young-hoon
                    arrived severely injured but exhilarated. He displays a Gang Sphere, destroying Seo Eun-hyun's
                    house. A cultivator appears, as he was chasing Kim Young-hoon. Seo Eun-hyun carries Kim Young-hoon
                    on his back while flees from the cultivator, who uses Jiangshi (moving corpses). After fleeing for
                    three days and nights, the cultivator takes control of Kim Young-hoon's corpse. While fighting Kim
                    Young-hoon's Jiangshi, Seo Eun-hyun finally takes a step into the Pinnacle Realm. Seo Eun-hyun
                    destroys Kim Young-hoon's body, dying.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun decides to join the Imperial Court. This will let him have more contact with
                    cultivators. He ascends the ranks in five years, going from the Military to the Shadow Squad, who
                    protected the Emperor. There, he learns that the Emperor of Yanguo himself and his family were
                    cultivators. Seo Eun-hyun and the Shadow Guard fight off many assassins daily for the next ten
                    years, as Seo Eun-hyun reached the mid-Peak stage.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun deduces the Emperor is sacrificing the poor and grinding them into pills to assist in
                    Cultivation. He also finds out that the Emperor is part of a cultivator clan called the Makli Clan.
                    He leaves the Shadow Guard and joins Kim Young-hoon. They seek help from the Jin Clan, who are the
                    rivals of the Makli clan and the ones sending assassins after the Emperor. The Wulin Alliance, the
                    Jin Clan, and Seo Eun-hyun attack the Makli Clan. Kim Young-hoon gives Seo Eun-hyun the Secrets of
                    Gazing Scripture, the evolved version of the unnamed Record, and names the realm he has reached as
                    Ultimate Pinnacle.</p>

                <p>At a particular estate of the Makli Clan, Seo Eun-hyun has to fight the Shadow Guard. He kills the
                    leader of the Guard and immobilizes the rest as he begins to step into Three Flowers Gathering At
                    The Summit. The Crown Prince of Yanguo joins the Makli Clan's defence as well. The prince and Seo
                    Eun-hyun's fight is brutal. Seo Eun-hyun truly enters Three Flowers and almost slices off the
                    prince's head. The prince activates a life-saving treasure which severs Seo Eun-hyun's head and
                    kills him. Seo Eun-hyun's body moves and kills the Prince.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun decides to go to the Jin Clan and join them. Seeing his martial arts, the Jin Clan lets
                    him join and has him train their assassins. Seo Eun-hyun has a chill as he saw five hundred
                    children. All of their families had been murdered by the Makli Clan, and by their own will, the
                    children had decided to become assassins. What was even more chilling was the fact that in his past
                    life, most of the children were killed using his own hands. Seo Eun-hyun trains the children from
                    sunrise to sunset and then, again at sunrise, only stopping if they faint. The training is gruesome
                    but due to their insane resentment towards the Makli Clan, the children persevere. While training
                    the children, Seo Eun-hyun started to see emotions as color. He talks to Kim Young-hoon who, in a
                    spar, shows Seo Eun-hyun how emotions can be infused with martial arts.</p>

                <p>The Jin Clan, ignoring Seo Eun-hyun's recommendation, give the children their families' souls,
                    strengthening them, but also decreasing their lifespan and their mental state. Nok-hyeon, infuriated
                    with Seo Eun-hyun, ran away in a bid to kill the Emperor. Seo Eun-hyun followes and leads him back.
                    Seo Eun-hyun decides to adopt a different teaching method. Starting from that point, all the
                    children were to try to assassinate him.</p>

                <p>After some time, the Jin Clan decides to attack the Makli Clan directly. In a fight, 34 of Seo
                    Eun-hyun's disciples die. Seo Eun-hyun orders the survivors to return and train harder. The children
                    do not accept it. As the war goes on, more of his disciples die and Seo Eun-hyun ages at an alarming
                    pace.</p>

                <p>The clans recieve permission to have a battle over the throne in the capital. They must only involve
                    Qi Refining Cultivators and Mortals to ensure there isn't a full-scale war. The Makli Clan could use
                    Makli Wangshin, a Qi Building cultivator. Seo Eun-hyun decides to not let his disciples participate
                    which led to the children revolting against him. Seeing this, Kim Young-hoon inadvertly reveals that
                    the children who died did not have their souls appeased. Seo Eun-hyun asked Kim Young-hoon to let
                    the unappeased spirits accumulate in Seo Eun-hyun's body, causing him to age rapidly. This touches
                    the children, and they promise to live after their revenge is complete.</p>

                <p>Before the battle begins, Seo Eun-hyun receives the Record of Surpassing Cultivation and Martial Arts
                    from Kim Young-hoon. During the battle, Makli Wangshin was killed by Kim Young-hoon and Kim
                    Young-hoon was severely wounded by Wangshin. Wangshin posseses his descendant in a bid to kill all
                    the mortals. Seo Eun-hyun decided to use his swordsmanship to block Wangshin while the others healed
                    Kim Young-hoon. While fighting Wangshin, Seo Eun-hyun nearly kills him using Endless Mountains
                    Beyond Mountains. Towards the end of the fight, he reaches Five Energies Converging to the Origin.
                    He uses his last strike to free the souls inside his disciples. The children kill Wangshin. They
                    stand beside their master's body and bid him farewell.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun immediately rejuvenates. He receives a recommendation to the Cheongmun Clan from the
                    Azure Tiger Saint. The Mad Lord gives him his first Cultivation technique after recognising Seo
                    Eun-hyun as a Five Energies martial artist. Seo Eun-hyun quietly goes to the Emperor's residence and
                    assassinates him in his sleep. Seo Eun-hyun decides to join the Cheongmun Clan. In a week, he
                    activates the Law Transforming Dantian and starts learning the Earth Surpassing Path of cultivation.
                    He joins the envoy of the Cheongmun Clan and goes to Jin Clan where Kim Young-hoon was an elder. Seo
                    Eun-hyun visits his disciples from his past life and is relieved to see them living well. Seo
                    Eun-hyun returns to the Cheongmun Clan and becomes a disciple of Cheongmun Ryeong. Ryeong is an
                    elder known to be one of the Three Greats as a formation and basic techniques master. He is stuck at
                    early stage Qi Building. Ryeong treats Seo Eun-hyun coldly at first but he softend up while teaching
                    him Understanding Before Breakthrough. This would allow him to understand the concept of any
                    Cultivation technique.</p>

                <p>It takes Seo Eun-hyun 10 years to complete the 1st Star of Qi Refining, 12 years for the 2nd Star, 6
                    years for the 3rd Star, 5 years for the 4th Star, 7 years for the 5th star, and 3 years for the 6th
                    star. For a total of 43 years. The 7th star requires a cultivator to perform a ritual to the
                    Heavens. However, every time Seo Eun-hyun tries to perform the ritual, clouds blocked his path. This
                    was called Heavenly Rejection.</p>

                <p>Kim Young-hoon gives Seo Eun-hyun the Record of Surpassing Path and Martial Arts. As his death is
                    approching, he joins Kim Young-hoon in a pursuit to attack a Makli Clan elder. After they kill the
                    Elder, another Makli Clan cultivator appears, along with a disciple at mid-stage Qi Building. Seo
                    Eun-hyun is about to die fighting the young cultivator, when Cheongmun Ryeong appears. Ryeong shows
                    Seo Eun-hyun the power of Understanding Before Breakthrough and displays Core Formation prowess.</p>

                <p>During the fight, Seo Eun-hyun's fated lifespan ends. Fate does everything it can to kill him, with
                    absolutely random events, such as a heart attack, a tree falling on him and snake bite. Seo Eun-hyun
                    does his best to survive so he can see his master's last teachings. After the fight, Ryeong is in
                    deep sorrow and pain. seeing his disciple die. Before Seo Eun-hyun dies, Ryeong transferred the
                    knowledge of all his techniques to Seo Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>After Seo Eun-hyun's death, Ryeong plants and grows a Quince tree where he died.</p>
