                <p>Eun-hyun attempts to convince Sir Byuk-ho, White Bone Ghost Devil and Azure Tiger Saint to accept him
                    into their sects, but they refuse, citing their coming ascension. They also warn him to stay away
                    from Mad Lord, as he may lose his sanity at any time. He manages to convince the Sea Dragon King to
                    take Kim Yeon with him. The Dragon King creates a rift for Eun-hyun and Young-hoon to exit Ascension
                    path, but Eun-hyun chooses to stay. Eun-hyun notices a stele floating above the ascension gate, with
                    an incomplete warning for future generations. He wonders what it means, before settling down to
                    cultivate. It took him ten years to reach Qi Refining 7th Star. Eun-hyun attemps the 7th Star
                    Ritual. Due to isolation and desperation, he went crazy, hallucinating all the people he had met
                    over his regressions, controlling numerous weapons through Sword Contol. He investigates the stele
                    and realises the original structure has flown off north. He eventually creates a Gang Sphere,
                    reaching Ultimate Pinnacle. He uses the Gang Sphere to break through the clouds of Heavenly
                    Rejection, and succefully completes the Seven Star Ritual. He also forms an Inner Core to
                    efficiently store his internal energy.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching the 9th star, Eun-hyun decides to leave Ascension Path. He heads north, to find the
                    remains of the stele and is stunned to discover the words "Golden Divine Heaven Thunder" on it. He
                    sees a mysterious black castle, but decides against exploring it. He then goes to the Cheongmun Clan
                    again to meet Cheongmun Ryeong. He rejects Cheonmun Ryeong's offer of joining the clan after
                    learning the foundations of the 8th to the 14th Star from him. Eun-hyun then reaches out to Kim
                    Young-hoon. Young-hoon has reached Ultimate Pinnacle and killed the Makli Clan. He was then
                    protected by the Jin Clan. Eun-hyun cultivates for the rest of his lifespan, reaching Qi Refining
                    14th Star. Towards the end, he goes to Shengzi and attempts to defy his lifespan. However, he is
                    struck by blue lightning, and dies.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun is acknowledged by the White Fox of Ascension Path and The Immortals that take his
                    colleagues, who mistake his Inner Core for a Demon Core. Azure Tiger Saint gives him a
                    recommendation for the Cheongmun Clan. Jin Byuk-ho tells him about Shattered Heaven Peak, where
                    Eun-hyun could learn about the history of Yang Su-jin and the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect.
                    The Sea Dragon King gives him a demon beast method, and tells Eun-hyun to go to Black Wind Sea's
                    Utmost Chaos Island, where Eun-hyun could learn Demon Script from Seo Hweol's descendant, Seo Ran.
                </p>

                <p>For the next 11 years, Eun-hyun stays in Ascension Path and recovers his cultivation to the 14th Star
                    Of Qi Refining. He goes to Cheongmun Ryeong once more to obtain his teachings. As he leaves, the
                    entire attemps Cheongmun Clan to chase Eun-hyun down to recruit him forcibly, but he escapes.</p>

                <p>After seeing his disciples, Eun-hyun tracks Young-hoon down. In the time Eun-hyun had reached the
                    14th Star of Refining, Kim Young-hoon had reached Five Energies Converging To The Origin. After a
                    spar, Eun-hyun leaves to go find Seo Ran. Young-hoon promises his realm will be above Eun-hyun's
                    next time they meet. Eun-hyun then went to the Black Wind Sea's Utmost Chaos Island where he met Seo
                    Ran. Seo Ran tells Eun-hyun he feels like a complete demon. Eun-hyun then proceeds to awaken his
                    demon senses. Seo Ran proceeds to teach Eun-hyun the demon language and script. After Eun-hyun
                    learns the language, he promises Seo Ran he will help him destroy a particular barrier and obtain
                    the treasure inside in three years. Eun-hyun discovers the manual given to him by Seo Hweol is
                    titled Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation. He practices the technique for a year and realises his
                    consciousness can turn into that of a Dragon. He then travels to Shattered Heaven Peak in Shengzi,
                    where he spends months attempting the advancement to Qi Building. He travels to meet Young-hoon in
                    hopes of furthering his enlightenment in Ultimate Pinnacle. He realises both of them had different
                    elightenments; while Eun-hyun achieved through the principle of Three Talents, Young-hoon seemed to
                    used "family". Eun-hyun then shares the awakening of demon senses with Young-hoon. They spend time
                    discussing demon methods.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun then leaves to keep his promise with Seo Ran. Seo Ran reveals he needed three years to
                    prepare a dharma treasure. They go to the shipwreck of a Nether Crossing Ship, All the ghosts around
                    the ship scream at Eun-hyun, calling him a big ghost. At the bottom layer of the Nether Crossing
                    Ship, they find the remenant of a Heavenly Being cultivator, now at the Core Formation stage.
                    Overwhelmed, Seo Ran and Eun-hyun flee from the remenant soul. Seo Ran tells Eun-hyun to return in
                    ten years, so he has enough energy in his dharma treasure to combat the ghost.</p>

                <p>Seo Eun-hyun then leaves for the mountains near Yanguo and begins practising the Water Surpassing
                    Path. He realises practising multiple path with the Surpassing Path to Cultivation increases his
                    rate of recovery. Kim Young-hoon visits and rants about being unable to see the next realm.
                    Young-hoon also warns Eun-hyun from practising Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation, as a
                    dragon-shaped consciousness does not suit humans. After that, Young-hoon would visit more
                    frequently, and the two would discuss and share their learnings. A few years later, a Jin Clan
                    cultivator tracks down Eun-hyun's dwelling. They have a short duel, which Eun-hyun wins. He then
                    leaves for the Black Sea.</p>

                <p>Seo Ran and Eun-hyun challenge the Nether Crossing Ship again. The ghost reveals he has found Seo
                    Ran's treasure; it is a jade slip. This time they severely weaken the remnant ghost. The ghost gives
                    up resisting the pull of the Netherworld and instead enters a berserk state. Eun-hyun tells Seo Ran
                    they must escape, but Seo Ran refuse to leave without the jade slip. Eun-hyun attempts to seize the
                    jade slip. He succeeds, but is nearly killed by the ghost. Seo Ran steps in and blocks the attack
                    sustaining a fatal wound. Seo Ran transforms into his true form, revealing himself as a dragon-human
                    hybrid. He states he was bullied and discriminated against within the Sea Dragon race. Eun-hyun
                    attempts to drag Seo Ran away, but is stunned when he can't move his body. Seo Ran reveals the true
                    name of Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation, is Summoning Wind, Coagulating Core Transformation.
                    It turns the practitioner's demon core into a elixir and forces the practitioner to obey the Sea
                    Dragon race's commands. The ancestors of the Makli Clan used this art. Consuming Eun-hyun's core
                    would let Seo Ran escape, but he cannot do that to friend. Seo Ran tells Eun-hyun Seo Hweol is not
                    to be trusted as he wears his smiles as masks. He apologises for deceiving Eun-hyun all this time.
                    Eun-hyun attemps to free himself in order to save Seo Ran, but Seo Ran stops him and reveals the
                    space-breaking bead given to him by Seo Hweol, which would destroy the Nether Crossing Ship and kill
                    him. Seo Ran forces Eun-hyun outside, and detonates the space-breaking bead.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun mourns the death of Seo Ran. He takes the demon beast manuals previously possessed by Seo
                    Ran and gives them to Young-hoon. He leaves for Shattered Heaven Peak to master the Fire Surpassing
                    Path. Kim Young-hoon contacts him, give him Entering Heavens Beyond the Path Martial Arts, and burns
                    his life in an attempt to reach the next realm. Eun-hyun mourns the death of both of his friends and
                    continues cultivating. As blue lightening strikes him, he realises Heaven, Earth and Man influence
                    each other, forming nine Gang Spheres.</p>

            <h2 class="cycle-title">9th Regression</h2>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Eun-hyun realises his head is about to explode as his body cannot support his large consciousness. He
                    quickly undergoes rejuvenation and forms an inner core. This attracts the white fox, who attacks
                    him. The fox chases him for three days. On the third day, the White Bone Devil and Sir Byuk-ho kill
                    the fox for its demon core. Eun-hyun attempts to convince them to take Kim Yeon and Oh Hye-seo along
                    with the other three, but the Mad Lord senses Kim Yeon’s consciousness and confronts them. During
                    their exchange, Oh Hye-seo awakens her abilities, calling the Sea Dragon King. Seo Hweol mediates
                    between them, leading to the original master-disciple distribution as fated. He then gives Eun-hyun
                    the manual for Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation and the space-breaking bead, which he was
                    unable to give to Seo Ran this cycle. All the cultivators except Mad Lord leave. Eun-hyun asks Mad
                    Lord about fate. Mad Lord shows him how ‘fate’ resembles ‘constellations’ and how events exert
                    ‘attraction force’ just like celestial objects. He says it is necessary to have power (strength) to
                    escape the force of fate. He then goes mad and pushes Eun-hyun and Kim Young-hoon into a spatial
                    rift.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun leaves after settling Young-hoon in Yanguo. He throws the space-breaking bead into the sea,
                    and decides to meet Seo Ran after he reaches Qi Building, and settles down at Shattered Heaven Peak.
                    Thirteen years after the regression, Young-hoon tracks down Eun-hyun. Eun-hyun is stunned to see him
                    at the peak of Ultimate Pinnacle. Young-hoon says he does not want to walk the path to Entering
                    Heavens Beyond the Path alone, so has come to train with Eun-hyun. After a spar, Young-hoon tells
                    Eun-hyun he has realised the enlightenment for Entering Heavens is different for each person.</p>

                <p>One day, Young-hoon comes across Eun-hyun’s unconscious body training. He resolves to practise with
                    no fear of death. Soon after, Young-hoon reaches Entering Heavens, grasping the Surpassing Radiant
                    Saber, the manifestation of his desire to “return’. He tells Eun-hyun he has realised life is joy,
                    and collapses. Upon awakening, he is shocked to see Eun-hyun has already condensed his heart.
                    However, he refuses to say anything and simply seats himself on a mountain peak, waiting for
                    Eun-hyun to advance while nudging his heart essence. Eun-hyun is unaware of this and is instead
                    frustrated by Young-hoon’s silence. He continues his attempts to reach Qi Building and Entering
                    Heavens, but keeps failing. At the end of his lifespan, through Young-hoon’s hints, he finally
                    realises he is already perfect and advances to both, grasping the Formless Sword, the manifestation
                    of his desire to “break free from fate”. He also extends his lifespan by three hundred years. As he
                    nearly utters "Shattered Heaven Peak," he sees a message left by Yang Su-jin, informing Eun-hyun he
                    and his colleagues are Enders and that they should never reveal their fates.[1] They are attacked by
                    a cultivator patrol but fend it off easily. The then spar together, which Young-hoon barely wins, at
                    the cost of his health.</p>

                <p>After Young-hoon recovers, they leave to go to Seo Ran, and help him challenge the Nether Crossing
                    Ship. Eun-hyun and Young-hoon batter the ghost. The ghost attempts to possess Eun-hyun but is
                    severely damaged by his heart essence. He introduces himself as Song Jin and promises to fulfil any
                    wish the others have, in exchange for allowing him to pass on where he wishes. Seo ran finds the
                    jade slip, and Song Jin teaches Eun-hyun the method of steering the Nether Crossing Ship. He also
                    provides a Qi Building cultivation method, Yin Soul Ghost Incantation.</p>

                <p>Seo Ran, Eun-hyun and Young-hoon visit the Serving Command Palace, where they hope to find the
                    Longevity Fruit to extend Young-hoon’s lifespan. They discover they cannot enter the Palace as there
                    is a barrier. Eun-hyun is disappointed. On Young-hoon’s last day, Young-hoon cuts down the blue
                    lightning, denying fate. The next day, he is wrinkled and with white hair. He survives for another
                    49 days before cutting a rift using his Saber and vanishing, leaving some advice for Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>Seo Ran and Eun-hyun enter the Serving Command Palace. They find the place in ruins and a budding
                    Longevity Fruit. Eun-hyun decides to stay in the Palace and attempts to ripen the Longevity Fruit.
                    He also cultivates alongside the tree, practicing Yin Soul Ghost Incantation and Cheongmun Ryeong’s
                    Thousand Lusters to Forest Sea.</p>

                <p>250 years later, the Serving Command Palace opens above the Heaven-Treading desert. A set of Core
                    Formation cultivators fleeing from the Nascent Soul, Bloodwood practitioner Yuan Li. Yuan Li
                    collects the Serving Command Seal from the Palace. He offers to take Eun-hyun as a disciple, and
                    implants the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner. Eun-hyun refuses and attempts to run, cutting apart
                    space the same way Young-hoon did, but Yuan Li still captures him. He offers to take Eun-hyun as a
                    disciple again, but refuses. Eun-hyun destroys the Longevity Tree to prevent Yuan Li from taking it
                    and explodes from Yuan Li's attack. (Yuan Li mysteriously turns into a flower and perishes.)</p>

                <div class="message-item">
                    [I am Yang Su-jin, the first Sect Master of Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, the remnant shadow
                    of the fate left behind. You, the next generation's Ender. Entering this space means that you've
                    miraculously achieved the conditions I set. Before realizing your fate, entering Shattered Heaven
                    Peak, surviving the heavenly lightning, and uttering 'Shattered Heaven' - all Enders who
                    miraculously achieve this near-impossible probability can come here.]
                </div>
                <div class="message-item">
                    [I, the founder of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Yang Su-jin, have created an attraction
                    of fate within Shattered Heaven Peak that inevitably draws in Enders. Therefore, an Ender will
                    inevitably come to Shattered Heaven Peak at some point. However, for an Ender, who is less than a
                    bug before realizing their fate, to be struck by heavenly lightning here and survive against all
                    odds, and to then utter 'Shattered Heaven,' would require an unbelievable miracle. Such an event is
                    impossible, but without a miracle, there will be no escaping [it]s notice. Thus, I leave this
                    warning here for future generations, relying solely on the possibility of such a miracle.]

                    [Future generations, whether you are the next Ender, or the one after, or even thousands or millions
                    of generations later, never reveal the fate you have been given. I don't know what gift you may have
                    received, but under no circumstances should you ever speak of it. No matter where you go in the
                    Three Thousand Worlds, [it] will know what you have received. Keeping your fate a secret is the only
                    slim chance you have.]

                    vanished. Do not even think of returning to your homeland or escaping the curse of fate. Just give
                    up on the thought of cultivation, live ordinarily among mortals, and die an ordinary death.
                    Forgetting your homeland forever and living and dying that way is the only way to find happiness for
                    an Ender who has revealed their own fate.]

                    much stronger. Yet, many take their fate lightly and end up revealing it. I, too, once revealed my
                    fate and ended up like this, so, future generations, heed my warning. Even if you don't reveal your
                    fate, [it] will be after you, but if you do reveal your fate, any means of resistance against [it]
                    will completely disappear. Future generations, never take my warning lightly. Never...]
