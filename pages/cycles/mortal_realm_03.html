                <p>Eun-hyun's head does not burst immediately due to the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner implanted in
                    him by Yuan Li. He attempts to free his consciousness, and succeeds in gaining 70% mobility. The fox
                    senses him and attempts to thrash him, but Eun-hyun beats him and seizes the demon core. Mad Lord
                    senses his fight and arrives. Eun-hyun sees his heart essence is a withered, rotting tree with a
                    pulse of pink light. He suddenly realises Mad Lord can see his heart essence as well. Mad Lord is
                    overjoyed and attempts to subdue Eun-hyun, when he senses the Blood Curse Banner. He then attempts
                    to extract Yuan Li’s soul. This attracts Seo Hweol, who stops Mad Lord. Eun-hyun vomits when he sees
                    Seo Hweol’s heart essence. Seo Hweol and Mad Lord begin an intense battle, which attracts the
                    masters of the sects in the Head Realm. They pacify Mad Lord. Eun-hyun’s colleagues are once again
                    kidnapped by the fated masters, except for Kim Yeon, who goes with the Righteous Path Alliance
                    leader. Eun-hyun attempts to tell them about Yuan Li, but Seo Hweol stops him. He then gives
                    Eun-hyun Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation and the space-breaking bead with instructions to go
                    to Seo Ran. Eun-hyun and Kim Young-hoon remain on Ascension Path for six months, during which
                    Eun-hyun uses the Demon Core to reach Qi Building. Young-hoon is at Three Flowers. They leave
                    Ascension Path and stop by Cheon-sak city, where they get water and a change of clothes. Eun-hyun
                    leaves Young-hoon in Yanguo and goes to meet Seo Ran. Song Jin and Eun-hyun converse, at the end of
                    which Song Jin gives them permission to search for the jade slip. Seo Ran and Song Jin bond over the
                    former’s mother, and Song Jin takes Seo Ran as a disciple. He grants Eun-hyun three requests, which
                    include the One Emotion Method and Silica Great Earth Secrets. Eun-hyun decides to use the Earth
                    Secrets to help the Longevity Tree grow, and decides to seek out Cheongmun Ryeong for help. They
                    decide to ask for an artisan in Cheon-sak city. They arrive at Four-Pattern Law Talent Buk
                    Hyang-hwa’s shop, where a bet is taking place; the person who can bring out sixty percent or more
                    out of her artifacts, will get to take a trip with her. None of the cultivators manage to reach
                    sixty percent. Eun-hyun, disgusted by their amateur handling of the sword artifacts, displays 120%
                    power, and thereby wins the contest. Hyang-hwa tries to get Eun-hyun to accept a magical artifact,
                    but Eun-hyun refuses. Buk Hyang-hwa promises to make him an artifact he can’t refuse while working
                    on the formation for the Longevity Tree.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun asks Song Jin for the Nether Crossing Ship to travel to the Serving Command Palace. Song Jin
                    gives them three days. The head of the Cheongmun Clan, Cheongmun Jung-jin, accompanies them. Buk
                    Hyang-hwa tells Eun-hyun about her norigae, and how she is betrothed to the one who carries it.
                    Inside the Palace, Hyang-hwa admires the inlaid circuits. Jung-jin explores the upper floors, while
                    Ryeong and Eun-hyun set the formation down. As Eun-hyun is to set down to external formation,
                    Hyang-hwa follows him around, fiddling with the Palace’s circuits. He shows her one of Mad Lord’s
                    mostly intact puppets. In her excitement, Hyang-hwa accidentally activates a golden order that
                    lowers everyone’s cultivation by one realm and also activates guardian puppets. Hyang-hwa quickly
                    deactivates the golder order. Jung-jin comes down and asks Hyang-hwa to reactivate the order as he
                    noticed a barrier appear when it was active. They go to the top floor, but Jung-jin fails to break
                    through. He tells them to go back down while he gathers enough strength.</p>

                <p>On their last day in the Palace, Ryeong examines the barrier and tells Jung-jin where to strike. The
                    shattering of the barrier changes the prohibition on the exterior of the Palace, which prompts Song
                    Jin to leave. Meanwhile, Jung-jin, Ryeong, Hyang-hwa and Eun-hyun enter the control room. Eun-hyun
                    discovers a line of text asking why ascension blessing are prepared[1] They find two teleportation
                    arrays. Jung-jin takes Ryeong and escapes, but cannot return as the array deactivates. Eun-hyun is
                    forced to reveal his Core Formation prowess and the Formless Sword. Buk Hyang-hwa decides to create
                    an artifact perfectly suited for the Formless Sword, but Eun-hyun gives her three conditions-he
                    should be able to craft the sword, with ordinary material, and it should encompass all the changes
                    of his Formless Sword. They decide to take the “trip” Eun-hyun won. They go to see “World’s End”,
                    where Eun-hyun is stunned to discover the world is flat. They see a village plagued by a centipede
                    demon and decide to help it. The centipede claims eating human flesh will let it hatch a child with
                    a Demon Core. They kill the centipede out of pity. In a fit of spite, the centipede uses its dying
                    breath to make the nearby poisonous beasts attack the village. The village hold a festival, which
                    Hyang-hwa takes part in. Eun-hyun is guarding the village when he encounters a child with a book,
                    who claims to be waiting for her [Sister]. Eun-hyun is shocked to see the first chapter in the book
                    is titled “the Ender’s Tale”[2]. The book also contains a map of the Head realm, including Ascension
                    Path and Serving Command Palace. It also shows the sun and moon as a “pair of eyes”, leaving
                    Eun-hyun with a sinister feeling. Eun-hyun takes the girl to the festival, where he shares the Twin
                    Immortals Dance with Hyang-hwa. He later deconstructs the dance into a spear technique.</p>

                <p>On reaching Cheon-sak city, Jung-jin apologies to Hyang-hwa and Eun-hyun and promises them a favour.
                    The next day, Byeok Mun-seong kidnaps Hyan-hwa to forcibly advance her Four-pattern talent to a
                    Three-pattern. She is rescued by Eun-hyun. They set down the completed formation at Hyang-hwa’s
                    mother’s grave. Five years later, she advances to Qi Building. Ryeong leaves for the Cheongmun clan
                    to test the formation in a spiritually similar environment. Eun-hyun decides to stay in the city, as
                    he has fallen in love with Hyang-hwa. Days later, Young-hoon appears and challenges Eun-hyun to a
                    match. Young-hoon has reached the limits of Ultimate Pinnacle but is yet to reach Entering Heavens.
                    He teases Eun-hyun about Hyang-hwa, who he has yet to confess to. Hyang-hwa shows Eun-hyun the
                    repaired bee puppet, which comes with a teleportation function. He realises the puppet is based on
                    the seven emotions. Hyang-hwa studies the puppet and realises the Mad Lord was trying to break taboo
                    through his puppets. She uses this inspiration to enhance her design for Eun-hyun’s artifact.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Another five years pass. Eun-hyun ends up managing the artifact shop. Their neighbours call Eun-hyun
                    and Hyang-hwa a couple. Young-hoon enters Entering Heavens and immediately spars Eun-hyun. Towards
                    the end of their spar, Eun-hyun tells Young-hoon he plans to confess to Hyang-hwa. Cheongmun Ryeong
                    also returns, and both him and Young-hoon lampoon Eun-hyun’s single status. Eun-hyun attempts to
                    confess to Hyang-hwa, but she asks him to wait until tomorrow, so she can complete the design for
                    his artifact. The next day, Hyang-hwa’s father, Buk Joong-ho, prepares his wife’s grave for their
                    wedding ceremony. Just before confessing to Hyang-hwa, Eun-hyun smells blood. Yuan Li has arrived to
                    retrieve his blood soul. They fight bitterly against Yuan Li, but nearly everyone in Cheon-sak city
                    dies, and Young-hoon is fatally wounded. Hyang-hwa and Joong-ho teleport Eun-hyun out of the city.
                    Eun-hyun, who has run out of spiritual power, rushes back. He discovers everyone except Hyang-hwa is
                    dead; Hyang-hwa is dying. With her last breath she tells Eun-hyun she never loved him, but Eun-hyun
                    can see her intent is still dyed a clear pink(love).</p>

                <p>With Hyang-hwa’s death, Eun-hyun’s tears turn black. Curses pour from his seven orifices as he swears
                    to kill Yuan Li.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Fighting Yuan Li</h3>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Eun-hyun encounters Jung-jin and displays his strength, winning the right to participate in the
                    attack on Yuan Li. All the Core Formation cultivators gather and manage to seal Yuan Li within his
                    dharma treasure, which is a black castle. Yuan Li mocks them and says he will be free in two-hundred
                    years as then the Serving Command Palace will appear over his castle, breaking all seals near it.
                    The entire continent prepare for the final battle with Yuan Li. While leaving the scene, Eun-hyun
                    talks to Wolryang, the great-grandfather of Hyang-hwa’s original betrothed, whom Yuan Li killed ten
                    years ago. Eun-hyun returns to Cheon-sak city, to collect the remains of his loved ones. He
                    discovers Young-hoon’s Inner Core is gone. He collapses in grief, emitting more than three thousand
                    curses. He opens Hyang-hwa’s gift, which is a blueprint for a flying sword artifact called the
                    Colourless Glass Sword. He then leaves to attend Ryeong’s funeral.</p>

                <p>During a strategy meeting, Eun-hyun realises the golden order in the Serving Command Palace can lower
                    Yuan Li to Core Formation while he can still use martial arts. They use the Nether Crossing Ship to
                    go to the Palace. Eun-hyun asks Seo Ran to teach him how to use the space-breaking bead, which he
                    had kept all this time. Seo Ran is shocked and tells him to wait. Eun-hyun displays his full
                    strength under the golden order and sets down the formation for the Longevity Tree. On the return
                    trip, Song Jin tells Eun-hyun the bead can only be activated by one possessing the “True Origin
                    blood” of a Sea Dragon, and that the bead in question was for Seo Ran. Eun-hyun asks Song Jin for
                    help. The latter says Seo Ran can help him more, as the sealed Sea Dragon Palace should hold items
                    antagonistic to Yuan Li.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun helps Seo Ran break the seal placed by Seo Hweol. Seo Eun-hyun is surprised to see the
                    interior of the Sea Dragon Palace matches the Serving Command Palace. Seo Ran tells him Seo Hweol
                    claimed this would have an effect of “mental awakening”. As Eun-hyun wanders the Sea Dragon Palace,
                    he comes across a hallway with no prohibitions. He enters what he presumes is the astronomy room. He
                    is hit by a curse that leaves a message. [3] Eun-hyun follows the message and looks under the slabs,
                    to find Astronomer Jeon Hyang’s diary, left for Seo Ran. From the diary, he learns about how the sun
                    and moon do not exist in the realm, and hints about the true nature of both this world and Seo
                    Hweol. When Eun-hyun closes the diary, Seo Hweol’s remnant consciousness appears, causing the dharma
                    treasures in the Sea Dragon Palace to go berserk. Song Jin rescues them.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">What You Trampled On / The Path You Have Tread</h3>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Ten years later, Eun-hyun goes to a meeting of Core Formation Cultivators. He learns Wolryang is the
                    great-grandfather of Hyang-hwa’s original betrothed, whom Yuan Li killed ten years ago. Cheongmun
                    Jung-jin proposes the plan of fighting within the Serving Comamand Palace. The cultivators agree to
                    meet again in two hundred years.</p>

                <p>Two hundred years later, Byeok Mun-seong, along with two female cultivators, goes to fetch Eun-hyun.
                    Eun-hyun is staying within the cave of the centipede he had killed with Hyang-hwa. His prowess
                    appears to be at Core Formation despite him being in Qi Building. Byeok Mun-seong notices Eun-hyun
                    has left behind a carved a glass sculpture of himself and Hyang-hwa dancing the Twin Immortals
                    Dance. He keeps the sculpture.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun arrives at Cheon-sak city. He takes the 3000 most intact glass-sword-grave markers and
                    carves the circuits Hyang-hwa designed into each of them. He stores the newly made artifact. He
                    notices Mun-seong’s consciousness is also the deep blue of sorrow, and they promise to mourn
                    together once she is avenged.</p>

                <p>More than 200 Core Formation cultivators gather in front of Yuan Li’s black castle. The Serving
                    Command Palace begins its descent, freeing Yuan Li. The cultivators begin to harry Yuan Li with
                    varying degrees of success. Yuan Li suddenly notices they are creating an altar for a Core Formation
                    advancement. He notices the gates of the Palace opening, so ignores it. From within the Serving
                    Command Palace, the true Seo Eun-hyun emerges, revealing the one outside to be a cursed doll.
                    Eun-hyun begins his advancement ritual for Core Formation, while the other hold Yuan Li back. After
                    the ritual, Heavenly Tribulations strikes Eun-hyun, shocking all present. Eun-hyun uses the
                    Tribulation to sap Yuan Li’s strength. The lightning drops until all of Yuan Li’s defensive
                    treasures are broken and Eun-hyun uses him as a shield. Eun-hyun uses his newly acquired Dan Fire to
                    turn the Colourless Glass Swords into dharma treasures. Yuan Li is pushed into the Palace, and the
                    golden order is activated. Yuan Li begins the fight, mainly against Eun-hyun. Manli Min-lap and
                    Byeok Cheon-gi begin infusing energy into a cannon and the Heaven Striking Talisman containing the
                    strike of a Heavenly Being respectively. He reveals Young-hoon's Inner Core within one of his blood
                    spirits. Eun-hyun reclaims the Inner Core, striking a severe blow on Yuan Li. Cheon-gi launches the
                    talisman, and Min-lap fires the cannon. However, it is revealed the talisman in fact was the Heaven
                    Sealing Talisman, one that granted the target the body of a Heavenly Being. The Byeok Clan, Five
                    Eastern Lords, Jinlu Clan, Makli Clan and others reveal they serve Yuan Li. Yuan Li is unharmed due
                    to the talisman. Buk Mun-seong appears and uses the Heaven Striking Talisman to shatter Yuan Li’s
                    defense, with the help of the young cultivators of the Byeok Clan. Eun-hyun uses the moment to land
                    a strong hit on Yuan Li using the All-Heavens Sword, the final form of the Colourless Glass Sword.
                    Yuan Li uses his powers to kill a huge number of cultivators and absorbs their power. He summons his
                    blood body, and transfers himself into it. He begins using Summoning Wind, True Blood
                    Transformation. Seo Ran appears and uses the effects of Summoning Wind, Blood Core Coagulation to
                    control Yuan Li. He summons the spirits of all Yuan Li has killed over the years, and allows them to
                    take their revenge on Yuan Li. He channels their strength into Song Jin, who temporarily regains his
                    Heavenly Being Cultivation. Song Jin strikes him once, destroying half of the Palace, and leaves.
                    Yuan Li sacrifices part of his Nascent Soul to claim the Serving Command Seal, and “fate” starts to
                    ridiculously favour him. He is “coincidently” freed from Seo Ran’s control, and all of Eun-hyun’s
                    strikes are “coincidently” blocked by debris.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun comes across a dying Mun-seong, who tells him he loved Hyang-hwa as well. He begs Eun-hyun
                    to avenge her for both of them. Eun-hyun tells Mun-seong he understands, and to rest. He then enters
                    Yuan Li’s black castle. Song Jin tells Eun-hyun to protect Seo Ran. He enters with the Nether
                    Crossing Ship. He forcibly activates the space-breaking bead and commands the Ship to self-destruct,
                    passing on. Yuan Li has lost a large amount of power, but a remnant consciousness of Seo Hweol
                    protects him. Eun-hyun launches Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains. During the last fight, he raises
                    his martial realm to Treading Heavens Beyond the Path. He creates the Black Ghost Curse Banner, and
                    kills Yuan Li. He comforts Seo Ran in the aftermath of Song Jin’s death, and leaves with Yuan Li’s
                    head. As he travels to Cheon-sak city, the Curse Banners begin evolving into something much more
                    sinister.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Over two months later, he reaches his destination. He places the head down and goes to Hyang-hwa’s
                    workshop. He meets her remnant spirit. They dance together one last time. They tell each other they
                    love them. The Blood Curse Banners Eun-hyun left behind turn into the White Orchid Blessing
                    Incantation. Hyang-hwa passes on. As Eun-hyun dies, the Colourless Glass Swords return to him.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Eun-hyun realises the Colourless Glass Swords have returned with him. He realises the White-Red wine
                    helped attach the Swords to his soul. He rushes the fox and defeats it extremely flashily to get the
                    Mad Lord’s attention. He tells the Mad Lord how he and Buk Hyang-hwa killed the centipede demon, and
                    her subsequent death. The Mad Lord tells Eun-hyun to lead the way to Yuan Li. He breaks the
                    defensive barrier on Yuan Li’s black castle. Seo Hweol senses this and rushes to the spot. The Mad
                    Lord and Seo Hweol engage in battle while Eun-hyun goes to kill Yuan Li. During the one-sided
                    smack-down, Eun-hyun asks Yuan Li if he thinks life is a blessing, to which Yuan Li agrees. Eun-hyun
                    tells him he believes life is neither a blessing nor a curse, and kills him. He shows Yuan Li’s head
                    to Seo Hweol and the Mad Lord. Seo Hweol is initially disappointed, but later praises Eun-hyun for
                    having killed a massacrer. He then leaves. Eun-hyun attempts to slip away, but the Mad Lord senses
                    him and attempts to catch him to turn him into a puppet. Eun-hyun flees, hoping the Mad Lord will
                    let him go in order to participate in the Ascension. Eun-hyun manages to stay free for ten days,
                    before Mad Lord unleashes [Her], a puppet at the Four-Axis Stage. Eun-hyun contemplates suicide, but
                    decides to drink White-Red wine to make sure the Swords remain with him. Eun-hyun breaks into the
                    Nether-Crossing Ship, takes control of it, breaks into the Serving Command Palace, and drinks the
                    wine. However, the attraction force from [Her] is overwhelming. Eun-hyun mimics the Surpassing
                    Radiant Saber and ‘cuts’ through space to reach Song Jin. He gets Song Jin to attach a ghost to his
                    soul and promptly commits suicide</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Ascension</h3>
            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Upon awakening, Eun-hyun realises the ghost attached by Song Jin had been torn away. Instead of
                    hitting his companions’ pressure points, he lets them wake up and leads them to the cave. Once they
                    fall asleep, he meets the fox and forces it to give up its Demon Core. He keeps the now tiny fox and
                    returns with it to the cave. He does not take any action as all his colleagues are snatched up while
                    the Mad Lord throws him, the fox and Young-hoon into a spatial rift. They teleport underground.
                    Eun-hyun digs them out. While Young-hoon is asleep, he rapidly arranges all the necessities for the
                    world. He returns the fox’s Demon Core and orders it to protect Young-hoon. He then leaves with the
                    intention to study the Ascension Gate. On the way, he looks in on his disciples, exterminates the
                    Makli Clan, introduces Song Jin to Seo Ran, guides Seo Ran to Jeon Hyang’s diary, and attacks Yuan
                    Li. Overpowered, Yuan Li swears on the Nether Crossing Ship to follow Eun-hyun’s commands. He
                    discovers the remnant warning that was on the stele near Ascension Path. [4]</p>

                <p>On interrogating Yuan Li, Eun-hyun learns the black castle was a shrine to Yang Su-jin, and Yuan Li
                    is descended from the shrine keepers. He also reveals the names of the Middle Realms; Blood
                    Yin(which he intended to ascend to), True Devil, Ancient Force, Nether Ghost, Purple Gold, and
                    Bright Cold(connected to the Ascension Gate). On Eun-hyun’s further questioning, he reveals he has
                    yet to ‘synthesize’ his cultivation into the Blood Body. Song Jin shifts through Yuan Li’s mind and
                    reveals all information related to Seo Hweol has been ‘erased’. Eun-hyun then kills Yuan Li. He
                    claims the Blood Body as spoils of war. He returns Wolryang’s norigae. When he goes to meet
                    Hyang-hwa, he realises she is now a completely different person. Their norigaes merge into one. He
                    leaves the strengthened norigae with Hyang-hwa. Back on the Ship, Eun-hyun asks Song Jin for the
                    Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun controls the Blood Body to exhort the traitorous Byeok clan. He then goes with the stones to
                    the Cheongmun Clan and tells them to support Cheongmun Ryeong. He then goes to the traitorous Jinlu
                    Clan and tells them to serve the Cheongmun Clan. He visits the village where he and Hyang-hwa fought
                    together, and asks for the book of fairy tales he came across last time, but discovers it has
                    vanished. On asking about the child’s sister, her father says she is an only child. This confuses
                    Eun-hyun, and he then seems to remember the child was waiting for her parents last cycle.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun goes to kill the centipede demon. The centipede begs Eun-hyun to take its offspring and turn
                    them into intelligent beasts. He accepts and takes all the eggs.</p>

                <p>In the serving command palace, Eun-hyun stores Immortal Demon Bamboo(a smoking-pipe for awakening
                    Demon Beasts), some talismans, and drinks some White-Red wine. He then acquires the Serving Command
                    Seal. On seeing the blessing bestowed on Eun-hyun, Song Jin remarks Eun-hyun has a strong fate.
                    Eun-hyun gives him the blueprints for the Longevity Tree Formation and asks him to deliver one to
                    Kim Young-hoon. They then arrive at Ascension Path. Eun-hyun blows some smoke to help awaken the
                    centipedes. One of them clings to Eun-hyun, and on Song Jin’s advice, he decides to keep it. One
                    attempting to examine Ascension Gate, Eun-hyun sees a message from Yang Su-jin, who tells him to
                    depart from this “ominous head”[5]. Ascension Gate swallows Eun-hyun, ejecting the Serving Command
                    Seal, and closing. Eun-hyun has begun his ascension</p>

                <p>During the ascension, he turns back to see the world he left behind as a gigantic jade something
                    before losing consciousness. He wakes up with no recollection of what he saw. He uses all his
                    talismans to arrive safely, right behind the Heavenly Being cultivators who took his colleagues. A
                    Four-Axis wood-man cultivator attempts to intimidate him, but is rebuffed by the newly advanced
                    Heavenly Being cultivators from the same realm as Eun-hyun. The wood-man cultivator stops and says
                    they must be from the Head Realm. The ascenders from the Head Realm offer to take Eun-hyun into
                    their respective sects. Eun-hyun lets the Formless Sword melt into his body. This ‘aura’ is detected
                    by the wood-man who accuses Eun-hyun of being a ‘Heart Tribe spy’ and kills him.</p>

                    *Once upon a time, there was a Supreme Deity who ruled the heavens.<br>
                    The Supreme Deity had seven beloved disciples, and one day, they had a great dispute with the
                    Supreme Deity.<br>
                    The disciples left the heavenly realm ruled by the Supreme Deity and descended to the human
                    world.<br>
                    The Supreme Deity, seeing that the seven disciples did not obey his command, called them Enders.<br>
                    But the human world was harsh, and the seven Enders shed tears of pain, longing for the heavenly
                    realm.<br>
                    Seeing this, the Supreme Deity created a path to ascend to the heavens so that the seven disciples
                    could return, and made it possible for them to reach the heavens by walking this path.<br>
                    It is said that the seven Enders walked the heavenly path laid by the Supreme Deity, returned to the
                    heavenly realm he ruled, and lived happily beside him, assisting him.

                    ―A warning to future generations: all immortal treasures in the world are ultimately connected to
                    True Immortals and the force of attraction. For those who are not yet prepared and are connected to
                    True Immortals, calamity will inevitably come. ne of the few advantages of this grotesque and
                    bizarre world is that due to its ominous nature, most True Immortals find it difficult to read and
                    locate heavenly fate. Therefore, descendants. If you happen to obtain an immortal treasure, or
                    something of the Immortal Realm, leave it in this world. Do not underestimate the desires and powers
                    of those who have reached the Great Boundary. Those who possess an immortal treasure and ascend will
                    inevitably be noticed by True Immortals, no matter where they ascend to. Especially my descendants.
                    Growing up in the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, if you happen to possess the Heavenly
                    Lightning Banner, heed my warning, and …
