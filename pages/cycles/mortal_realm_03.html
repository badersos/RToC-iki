                <p>Eun-hyun's head does not burst immediately due to the Five Elements Blood Curse Banner implanted in
                    him by Yuan Li. He attempts to free his consciousness, and succeeds in gaining 70% mobility. The fox
                    senses him and attempts to thrash him, but Eun-hyun beats him and seizes the demon core. Mad Lord
                    senses his fight and arrives. Eun-hyun sees his heart essence is a withered, rotting tree with a
                    pulse of pink light. He suddenly realises Mad Lord can see his heart essence as well. Mad Lord is
                    overjoyed and attempts to subdue Eun-hyun, when he senses the Blood Curse Banner. He then attempts
                    to extract Yuan Li’s soul. This attracts Seo Hweol, who stops Mad Lord. Eun-hyun vomits when he sees
                    Seo Hweol’s heart essence. Seo Hweol and Mad Lord begin an intense battle, which attracts the
                    masters of the sects in the Head Realm. They pacify Mad Lord. Eun-hyun’s colleagues are once again
                    kidnapped by the fated masters, except for Kim Yeon, who goes with the Righteous Path Alliance
                    leader. Eun-hyun attempts to tell them about Yuan Li, but Seo Hweol stops him. He then gives
                    Eun-hyun Summoning Wind, Dragon Transformation and the space-breaking bead with instructions to go
                    to Seo Ran. Eun-hyun and Kim Young-hoon remain on Ascension Path for six months, during which
                    Eun-hyun uses the Demon Core to reach Qi Building. Young-hoon is at Three Flowers. They leave
                    Ascension Path and stop by Cheon-sak city, where they get water and a change of clothes. Eun-hyun
                    leaves Young-hoon in Yanguo and goes to meet Seo Ran. Song Jin and Eun-hyun converse, at the end of
                    which Song Jin gives them permission to search for the jade slip. Seo Ran and Song Jin bond over the
                    former’s mother, and Song Jin takes Seo Ran as a disciple. He grants Eun-hyun three requests, which
                    include the One Emotion Method and Silica Great Earth Secrets. Eun-hyun decides to use the Earth
                    Secrets to help the Longevity Tree grow, and decides to seek out Cheongmun Ryeong for help. They
                    decide to ask for an artisan in Cheon-sak city. They arrive at Four-Pattern Law Talent Buk
                    Hyang-hwa’s shop, where a bet is taking place; the person who can bring out sixty percent or more
                    out of her artifacts, will get to take a trip with her. None of the cultivators manage to reach
                    sixty percent. Eun-hyun, disgusted by their amateur handling of the sword artifacts, displays 120%
                    power, and thereby wins the contest. Hyang-hwa tries to get Eun-hyun to accept a magical artifact,
                    but Eun-hyun refuses. Buk Hyang-hwa promises to make him an artifact he can’t refuse while working
                    on the formation for the Longevity Tree.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun asks Song Jin for the Nether Crossing Ship to travel to the Serving Command Palace. Song Jin
                    gives them three days. The head of the Cheongmun Clan, Cheongmun Jung-jin, accompanies them. Buk
                    Hyang-hwa tells Eun-hyun about her norigae, and how she is betrothed to the one who carries it.
                    Inside the Palace, Hyang-hwa admires the inlaid circuits. Jung-jin explores the upper floors, while
                    Ryeong and Eun-hyun set the formation down. As Eun-hyun is to set down to external formation,
                    Hyang-hwa follows him around, fiddling with the Palace’s circuits. He shows her one of Mad Lord’s
                    mostly intact puppets. In her excitement, Hyang-hwa accidentally activates a golden order that
                    lowers everyone’s cultivation by one realm and also activates guardian puppets. Hyang-hwa quickly
                    deactivates the golder order. Jung-jin comes down and asks Hyang-hwa to reactivate the order as he
                    noticed a barrier appear when it was active. They go to the top floor, but Jung-jin fails to break
                    through. He tells them to go back down while he gathers enough strength.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun encounters Jung-jin and displays his strength, winning the right to participate in the
                    attack on Yuan Li. All the Core Formation cultivators gather and manage to seal Yuan Li within his
                    dharma treasure, which is a black castle. Yuan Li mocks them and says he will be free in two-hundred
                    years as then the Serving Command Palace will appear over his castle, breaking all seals near it.
                    The entire continent prepare for the final battle with Yuan Li. While leaving the scene, Eun-hyun
                    talks to Wolryang, the great-grandfather of Hyang-hwa’s original betrothed, whom Yuan Li killed ten
                    years ago. Eun-hyun returns to Cheon-sak city, to collect the remains of his loved ones. He
                    discovers Young-hoon’s Inner Core is gone. He collapses in grief, emitting more than three thousand
                    curses. He opens Hyang-hwa’s gift, which is a blueprint for a flying sword artifact called the
                    Colourless Glass Sword. He then leaves to attend Ryeong’s funeral.</p>

                    Jung-jin proposes the plan of fighting within the Serving Comamand Palace. The cultivators agree to

                    love them. The Blood Curse Banners Eun-hyun left behind turn into the White Orchid Blessing
                    Incantation. Hyang-hwa passes on. As Eun-hyun dies, the Colourless Glass Swords return to him.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Eun-hyun realises the Colourless Glass Swords have returned with him. He realises the White-Red wine
                    helped attach the Swords to his soul. He rushes the fox and defeats it extremely flashily to get the
                    Mad Lord’s attention. He tells the Mad Lord how he and Buk Hyang-hwa killed the centipede demon, and
                    her subsequent death. The Mad Lord tells Eun-hyun to lead the way to Yuan Li. He breaks the
                    defensive barrier on Yuan Li’s black castle. Seo Hweol senses this and rushes to the spot. The Mad
                    Lord and Seo Hweol engage in battle while Eun-hyun goes to kill Yuan Li. During the one-sided
                    smack-down, Eun-hyun asks Yuan Li if he thinks life is a blessing, to which Yuan Li agrees. Eun-hyun
                    tells him he believes life is neither a blessing nor a curse, and kills him. He shows Yuan Li’s head
                    to Seo Hweol and the Mad Lord. Seo Hweol is initially disappointed, but later praises Eun-hyun for
                    having killed a massacrer. He then leaves. Eun-hyun attempts to slip away, but the Mad Lord senses
                    him and attempts to catch him to turn him into a puppet. Eun-hyun flees, hoping the Mad Lord will
                    let him go in order to participate in the Ascension. Eun-hyun manages to stay free for ten days,
                    before Mad Lord unleashes [Her], a puppet at the Four-Axis Stage. Eun-hyun contemplates suicide, but
                    decides to drink White-Red wine to make sure the Swords remain with him. Eun-hyun breaks into the
                    Nether-Crossing Ship, takes control of it, breaks into the Serving Command Palace, and drinks the
                    wine. However, the attraction force from [Her] is overwhelming. Eun-hyun mimics the Surpassing
                    Radiant Saber and ‘cuts’ through space to reach Song Jin. He gets Song Jin to attach a ghost to his
                    soul and promptly commits suicide</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Upon awakening, Eun-hyun realises the ghost attached by Song Jin had been torn away. Instead of
                    hitting his companions’ pressure points, he lets them wake up and leads them to the cave. Once they
                    fall asleep, he meets the fox and forces it to give up its Demon Core. He keeps the now tiny fox and
                    returns with it to the cave. He does not take any action as all his colleagues are snatched up while
                    the Mad Lord throws him, the fox and Young-hoon into a spatial rift. They teleport underground.
                    Eun-hyun digs them out. While Young-hoon is asleep, he rapidly arranges all the necessities for the
                    world. He returns the fox’s Demon Core and orders it to protect Young-hoon. He then leaves with the
                    intention to study the Ascension Gate. On the way, he looks in on his disciples, exterminates the
                    Makli Clan, introduces Song Jin to Seo Ran, guides Seo Ran to Jeon Hyang’s diary, and attacks Yuan
                    Li. Overpowered, Yuan Li swears on the Nether Crossing Ship to follow Eun-hyun’s commands. He
                    discovers the remnant warning that was on the stele near Ascension Path. [4]</p>

                <p>On interrogating Yuan Li, Eun-hyun learns the black castle was a shrine to Yang Su-jin, and Yuan Li
                    is descended from the shrine keepers. He also reveals the names of the Middle Realms; Blood
                    Yin(which he intended to ascend to), True Devil, Ancient Force, Nether Ghost, Purple Gold, and
                    Bright Cold(connected to the Ascension Gate). On Eun-hyun’s further questioning, he reveals he has
                    yet to ‘synthesize’ his cultivation into the Blood Body. Song Jin shifts through Yuan Li’s mind and
                    reveals all information related to Seo Hweol has been ‘erased’. Eun-hyun then kills Yuan Li. He
                    claims the Blood Body as spoils of war. He returns Wolryang’s norigae. When he goes to meet
                    Hyang-hwa, he realises she is now a completely different person. Their norigaes merge into one. He
                    leaves the strengthened norigae with Hyang-hwa. Back on the Ship, Eun-hyun asks Song Jin for the
                    Devil Legion Terracotta Scroll.</p>

                    *Once upon a time, there was a Supreme Deity who ruled the heavens.<br>
                    The Supreme Deity had seven beloved disciples, and one day, they had a great dispute with the
                    Supreme Deity.<br>
                    The disciples left the heavenly realm ruled by the Supreme Deity and descended to the human
                    world.<br>
                    The Supreme Deity, seeing that the seven disciples did not obey his command, called them Enders.<br>
                    But the human world was harsh, and the seven Enders shed tears of pain, longing for the heavenly
                    realm.<br>
                    Seeing this, the Supreme Deity created a path to ascend to the heavens so that the seven disciples
                    could return, and made it possible for them to reach the heavens by walking this path.<br>
                    It is said that the seven Enders walked the heavenly path laid by the Supreme Deity, returned to the
                    heavenly realm he ruled, and lived happily beside him, assisting him.

                    ―A warning to future generations: all immortal treasures in the world are ultimately connected to
                    True Immortals and the force of attraction. For those who are not yet prepared and are connected to
                    True Immortals, calamity will inevitably come. ne of the few advantages of this grotesque and
                    bizarre world is that due to its ominous nature, most True Immortals find it difficult to read and
                    locate heavenly fate. Therefore, descendants. If you happen to obtain an immortal treasure, or
                    something of the Immortal Realm, leave it in this world. Do not underestimate the desires and powers
                    of those who have reached the Great Boundary. Those who possess an immortal treasure and ascend will
                    inevitably be noticed by True Immortals, no matter where they ascend to. Especially my descendants.
                    Growing up in the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, if you happen to possess the Heavenly
                    Lightning Banner, heed my warning, and …
