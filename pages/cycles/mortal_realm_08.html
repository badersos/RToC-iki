            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>When Eun-hyun regains consciousness, he feels the 16th regression is missing from his memories, and
                    he
                    has directly skipped to the 17th regression. The curse of lightning still follows him. Both Jin
                    Byuk-ho, who mistakes the curse for the Lighting Sacred Body, and Heo Gwak, who can sense the death
                    within Eun-hyun’s soul, attempt to recruit him into their sects. When Eun-hyun chooses the Golden
                    Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect, Heo Gwak gives him a manual containing the Six Extremes Yin Lightning
                    Body
                    in the shape of a skull. During the Mad Lord’s usual rampage, Eun-hyun implants a Mysteriously
                    Bizarre Gu
                    in Kim Yeon.</p>

                <p>While the sect captures the Thunder Cloud Peak, two elders tell Eun-hyun he must dual-cultivate for
                    lightning methods. Eun-hyun is reluctant to do so as it would mean forming a bond with someone
                    [fated to
                    die]. Also, he still has Kim Yeon. He insists on waiting until he has completed the Seven Star
                    Ritual.
                    The elders wake Jeon Myeong-hoon up, who has been unconscious the entire time, and inject knowledge
                    within his mind. Myeong-hoon believes he has transmigrated to the world of “Thunder Daoist”, a
                    webnovel
                    he reads, and his arrogant attitude leads the elders into putting him back to sleep and into
                    etiquette
                    class.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Jin Byuk-ho is battling with Yeon Wei, formerly known as Jin Wei. Yeon Wei manages to push
                    back Jin Byuk-ho, until he undoes one of the seals of the Heavenly Lighting Banner, and launches an
                    attack to kill her. Yeon Wei tells Jin Byuk-ho about the Five Blessings Axes, and then flees in soul
                    form. Jin Byuk-ho sends an expedition to Nether Ghost to find more about the Axes, and begins an
                    investigation into Yeon Wei’s whereabouts.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun is assigned Jin Hwi as his master. Jin Hwi tells Eun-hyun his Lighting Sacred Body is
                    “lightning itself”, and allows Eun-hyun to cultivate all the methods of the sect on his request.
                    Eun-hyun
                    takes this opportunity to reach Earth Nascent Soul and Heaven Qi Refining 6th Star. He also absorbs
                    some
                    of the lightning from the Heavenly Tribulation. The Administrator of all Human Race Islands, Wi
                    Ryeong-seon senses the Tribulation and attempts to track the advancer down. Eun-hyun uses the
                    Record,
                    and hides within a market. He encounters a man selling surplus demon beast techniques from the Black
                    Scaled Fish Commanding Sect. He tells Eun-hyun serpent techniques are effective for centipedes,
                    leading
                    Eun-hyun to buy two methods for Hong Fan.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun buries pieces of his Nascent Soul around Thunder Cloud Peak, and seals his demon
                    cultivation. The entire sect is shocked when Eun-hyun reveals he has reached Qi refining 6th Star.
                    Before the Seven Star Ritual, Jin Hwi tells Eun-hyun his dual cultivation partner will be the
                    infamous
                    Grand Elder Hong, who coerced them to assign Eun-hyun to her. During the Seven Star Ritual, Eun-hyun
                    uses the lightning stored from the Tribulation to break through the Heavenly Rejection and complete
                    the
                    ritual, to Jin Hwi dumbfoundment. The day after the ritual, Elder Hong Su-ryeon comes to Eun-hyun’s
                    cave
                    residence. He realises she is at Five Energies Converging to the Origin. After a quick spar, Hong
                    Su-ryeon
                    assures Eun-hyun she will not experiment on him as his body– the Lighting Sacred Body– was her end
                    goal.
                    She aimed to artificially create the Lighting Sacred Body through transformation, similar to that of
                    Five Energies. She tells Eun-hyun she believes the concept of ‘talent’ does not exist. She then
                    displays
                    a formation she adopted after viewing Cheongmn Ryeong’s techniques. Eun-hyun precisely follows the
                    changes, leading Su-ryeong to doubt his age. She displays her "Extinguishing Lightning Inner
                    Heavenly
                    Temple", unification of her sword and cultivation, destroying a mountain peak with the energy of Qi
                    Building. Since mastering the basics can unleash huge amounts of power, she believes Talent must not
                    exist. In other words, TALENT IS FATE.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun learns more from Hong Su-ryeon than Jin Hwi, reaching Heaven Tribe Nascent Soul (which he
                    has kept secret). Hong Fan has reached Qi Refining 7th Star. Jeon Myeong-hoon has been released from
                    etiquette lessons. During his presentation to the sect, Jin Byuk-ho tells him it should take him an
                    hour
                    or so, to Myeong-hoon’s shock. However, Myeong-hoon is unable to understand the written content, as
                    he
                    is ignorant about basic concepts of the cultivation world. It takes him another three months to
                    reach Qi
                    Gathering. Eun-hyun has made his advancement to Nascent Soul public. Jin Byuk-ho gives Jin Jin-chan
                    permission to use any means to increase Myeong-hoon’s level. As a result, Myeong-hoon is treated to
                    lightning torture. It takes him a year and a half to reach Qi Refining 6th Star. Eun-hyun has
                    meanwhile
                    been attempting to master all the methods of the Sect. Before his Seven Stars Ritual, Myeong-hoon
                    encounters Hong Fan, who is at Qi Building, and feels respect for his unknown master.</p>

                <p>Once Jeon Myeong-hoon is faced with Heavenly Rejection, Jin So-hae brings Hong Fan to him. Hong Fan
                    begins instructing Myeong-hoon in Understanding Before Breakthrough, which he has learnt from his
                    master. Jeon Myeong-hoon remains unable to break through his Heavenly Rejection for ten years. For
                    these
                    ten years, only Jin So-hae, Hong Fan, and a few others remain by his side. Meanwhile, Eun-hyun has
                    cultivated all methods of the sect up to at least three stars. Hong Su-ryeon tells him the elders
                    believe all the methods combine into one technique.</p>

                <p>Jin Jin-chan goes to Myeong-hoon and tells him Myeong-hoon is to be refined into a pill. Myeong-hoon
                    is tossed into prison to await the pill refiner. So-hae rescues him and takes to a flying artifact
                    piloted by Hong Fan, who has reached Core Formation. Myeong-hoon promises himself he will only look
                    at
                    So-hae from now on. Eun-hyun lands next to So-hae and tells her to activate the grand formation.</p>

                <p>As Myeong-hoon and Hong Fan attempt to escape, they are chased by the elders of the sect. Myeong-hoon
                    begins absorbing the lightning cast by the elders and absorbs it into his dantian. He also begins
                    releasing red lightning. As they reach the Southern end of the gate, they are confronted by Jin
                    Jin-chan.
                    Jin-chan collects the lightning cast by Myeong-hoon, shapes it into a pillar, and plants it into the
                    Dragon Vein chasing Myeong-hoon. He orders Hong Fan to return to the sect. He apologises to
                    Myeong-hoon
                    and tells him about the sect’s plan to turn the entire island into an altar for the Seven Stars
                    Ritual.
                    As Myeong-hoon prepares to break through, Eun-hyun reaches mid-Nascent Soul. He has succeeded in
                    combining all the techniques of the sect, yielding a Universal Declaration of Human Rights modified
                    for
                    this universe. As he chants the Declaration, a remnant of Yang Su-jin appears.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Yang Su-jin tells Eun-hyun this is a space specially crafted by the Heavenly Venerable of
                    Netherworld, allowing him to pass on his thoughts. During their conversation, Eun-hyun learns about
                    Governing Immortals, and the entity called [The Emperor]. He tells Eun-hyun both of them have vile
                    fates. He says he created the technique Eun-hyun just learnt, the <strong>Extinguishing Divine
                        Tribulating
                        Heavens Technique</strong> to exchange his fate for a better one. The Golden Divine Thunder Sect
                    was
                    just a sacrificial offering. He tells Eun-hyun everybody is ‘non-human’, slaves to fate, except for
                    the
                    Enders. The Heart Tribe can only exist in the presence of Enders. As Yang Su-jin’s remnant fades, he
                    tells Eun-hyun to declare the Enders are the true humans. Eun-hyun returns to his body and faints
                    from
                    the remnant pressure of Netherworld.</p>

                <p>The next morning, Jin Byuk-ho confirms Eun-hyun has lost the lightning path. This means Eun-hyun has
                    also lost the lightning curse. He has also lost his spiritual roots. When Byuk-ho leaves, Eun-hyun
                    regains his spiritual roots through the Five Elements transformation. He has Hong Fan bring him Yeon
                    Jin,
                    and Yeon Wei within him, to ask how to use the Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens Technique.
                    Yeon
                    Wei tells him it is a technique to oppose the heavens. To achieve greatness in it, one must be
                    expelled
                    from the sect using the Ancestral Command. When Eun-hyun asks how he can seal the Banner in the Head
                    Realm, Yeon Wei tells him to advance to Heavenly Being, and he will naturally be able to descend to
                    the
                    Head Realm.</p>

                <p>Jeon Myeong-hoon asks So-hae to be dual-cultivation partners. So-hae allows it. Within a month, he
                    reaches the 13th Star of Qi Refining. Myeong-hoon tells Hong Fan he intends to pay his respects to
                    Hong
                    Fan’s master once he advances to Qi Building. During his advancement, he absorbs the Heavenly
                    Tribulation. As he finishes his advancement, he looks up to see a veritable waterfall of Tribulation
                    striking a nearby mountain peak– Eun-hyun has advanced from mid-Nascent Soul to Grand Perfection,
                    skipping the late stage. Seo Eun-hyun is declared the next-next Sect Leader and is renamed to Jin
                    Eun-hyun. The next day, Hong Fan brings Eun-hyun to his master, Eun-hyun. Myeong-hoon swallows his
                    pride
                    and accepts his laziness. He strives to overtake Eun-hyun as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>A month later, the sect hosts a grand ceremony for Jin Eun-hyun. During the ceremony, Hon Wei,
                    daughter of Grand Cultivator Hon Won, gatecrashes the party and demands Eun-hyun’s hand in marriage.
                    She
                    leaves a humongous amount of spirit stones and leaves after Eun-hyun rejects her. Her intent was,
                    however, not one of love, but that of a crafty old fox. After the celebration, the sect compares
                    notes
                    on Hon Wei, who has only reached mid-Heavenly Being in 3,120 years old. Hong Su-ryeong refuses to
                    give
                    up Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>After the meeting, Eun-hyun tells Jin Byuk-ho he ascended with the help of the Golden Deity, who also
                    gave him the Lighting Sacred Body, and a warning about the Heavenly Lighting Banner. He tells Jin
                    Byuk-ho the banner must be sealed in the Head Realm. Jin Byuk-ho tells him it is not feasible as
                    more
                    than half of the sect depends on the Wall Force Constitution, given to those born with the surname
                    Jin.
                    The Wall Force Constitution can only be bestowed by the Heavenly Lighting Banner. Sealing the Banner
                    would mean the sect would lose half of its strength. Those who ascend are given white belts to allow
                    the
                    usage of their constitution. These belts can only be made by the Ascentral Command, which can only
                    be
                    used once every hundred years. The only other way is for Myeong-hoon to grow powerful enough.
                    Eun-hyun
                    decides to train Myeong-hoon, who has already condensed six spiritual stars.</p>

                <p>Before that, he goes to visit Hong Su-ryeon, and spends the night with her. During the night, she
                    tells Eun-hyun about the seed of madness for Heavenly Being. The next day, Eun-hyun begins
                    Myeong-hoon’s
                    training, beating him while teaching him the intricacies of the Lighting Path method. During his
                    training, Eun-hyun notices ‘anger’ speeds up Myeong-hoon’s improvement. However, he cannot reach the
                    next layer of the Seven Lightning Quaking Scripture despite having the prerequisite cultivation
                    realm.
                    Eun-hyun feels Myeong-hoon’s anger is changing the method to a different one. Eun-hyun has paused
                    cultivation as Yang Su-jin’s word still haunt him. This even leads to a Heart Demon. Lost in
                    thought, he
                    is summoned by Kim Yeon into her dream. Within the dream, Eun-hyun promises to teach her martial
                    arts.

                <p>A year passes. Jin Eun-hyun has been receiving a monthly dowry fund from Hon Wei. During one of the
                    deliveries, Eun-hyun notices Hon Wei laying a foundation to suppress herself. He uses a Gu to spy on
                    her
                    and discovers she intends to have him dishonour her and be forced to take her as his wife. During
                    one of
                    his spars with Myeong-hoon, he is scratched. Myeong-hoon tells him he has learnt from Hong Fan.
                    Eun-hyun
                    realises he has learnt from these so-called non-humans, and is freed of the Heart Demon. This also
                    brings him one step closer to the next realm of Martial Arts. Eun-hyun begins teaching Hong Fan
                    martial
                    arts as well. When Hon Wei launches her plan, Eun-hyun foils it. Hon Wei tells him she needs to win
                    the
                    ‘love’ of the Golden Divine Thunder Sect to bag the position of vice-palace master, as her father’s
                    dead
                    lover was from the sect. They make a deal instead.</p>

                <p>A decade passes. Kim Yeon has reached early first-rate. Jeon Myeong-hoon is at Core Formation, guided
                    by the voice of lightning. He still emits only red lightning. Hong Fan is set to advance to Nascent
                    Soul.
                    During his advancement, a pillar of light strikes down at him. He dances within, similar to an
                    Imugi. He
                    transforms into an old man with a long beard. After the advancement is complete, Eun-hyun realises
                    Myeong-hoon has vanished. Myeong-hoon is being seduced by the Heavenly Lighting Banner, Zhengli,
                    into
                    releasing her and saying her name. Eun-hyun arrives in time and seals her name using a curse spell.
                    When
                    the two leave the hall, Zhengli uses something she ‘received’ for Myeong-hoon to break one layer of
                    her
                    seal.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun creates a second Nascent Soul for Yuan Yu. He and Hon Wei refine their deal from years ago,
                    adding a condition that (Jin Eun-hyun) + (Lighting Banner) + (three disciples) = GDTH. [1] He gets
                    Hong
                    Su-ryeon to agree to his proposal, as she can see his intent. She extracts a promise from Eun-hyun
                    to
                    not kill any pursuers.</p>

                <p>Zhengli has steadily been stoking Myeong-hoon’s sense of inferiority while Eun-hyun stokes his anger.
                    Eun-hyun has also been frantically training to advance his Heart Tribe cultivation. As he swings the
                    club-turned-sword, he realises the heart of his martial arts is Sincerity.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Twenty years later, Jeon Myeong-hoon has succeeded in evolving the Red Lightning Quaking Scripture
                    into the Owner of Heavenly Punishment’s Red Lightning Heavenly Tribulation Method through Zhengli’s
                    guidance. He is ready to advance to Nascent Soul. During his advancement, Eun-hyun senses a thread
                    of
                    intent from the Heavenly Lighting Banner. He confronts Zhengli. She manipulates his thoughts to
                    produce
                    lust, so Eun-hyun rips off his testicles and the part of his soul governing lust. As Myeong-hoon
                    reaches
                    Nascent Soul, Eun-hyun sees Zhengli break yet another one of her chains. She uses her regained
                    authority
                    to incite the elder of the sect to attack Eun-hyun out of lust and rage. Eun-hyun curses them and
                    runs.
                    Before he escapes, he has a bitter fight with Jeon Myeong-hoon, where Myeong-hoon momentarily
                    manages to
                    seize the Banner. In response, Eun-hyun pulls out his Three Thousand Colourless Glass Swords,
                    planting a
                    curse banner within his Nascent Soul. Zhengli is flustered as Myeong-hoon had begun escaping her
                    control. When Eun-hyun tells her he intends to seal her within the Head Realm, she begs him to
                    reconsider, calling it a terrifying place.</p>

                <p>Jin Eun-hyun meets Hon Wei. She contacts her father, Hon Won. Yuan Yu, Hong Su-ryeong and Yeon Jin
                    are presented as disciples of the new sect. Hon Won recognises Yeon Wei within Yeon Jin, and flies
                    into
                    a rage, recognising her as the monster that devoured his beloved. Hon Wei attacks Eun-hyun using the
                    Great Mountain Splitting Emperor technique of the Penglai Palace, revealing she is a Heaven and
                    Earth
                    Dual Cultivator. Eun-hyun manages to incapacitate her and flees to the Void Spirit Pond in the True
                    Devil Realm.</p>

                <p>Jin Byuk-ho communicates with the elders. He visits Jeon Myeong-hoon and is stunned to discover him
                    in a cold rage, preparing to challenge mid-Nascent Soul. He decides to create a pursuit team, with
                    Myeong-hoon at the head.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun breaks into the True Devil Realm with Hong Fan’s help. He meets up Yeon Wei and asks her how
                    Hon Won recognised her. Yeon Wei says Hon Won has suddenly gained a “supervisory eye” within five
                    hundred years. Eun-hyun also asks her why he still hasn’t risen to Heavenly Being. Yeon Wei tells
                    him
                    his madness must be too big, and thus he requires exorbitant amounts of spiritual energy to advance.
                    It
                    would take Eun-hyun at least 600 years to gather the required energy. He asks Yeon Wei to possess
                    Yuan
                    Yu and take him down to the Head Realm. It will take at least 10 before they can proceed.</p>

                <p>Five years later, the Human Alliance has tracked Seo Eun-hyun down. Jeon Myeong-hoon has reached
                    Grand Perfection of Nascent Soul. By proving himself as the strongest among the group, Jeon
                    Myeong-hoon
                    takes on the role of the leader of the Seo Eun-hyun Punitive Force. When the force arrives in True
                    Devil, a 1000-man team joins them. They say they have been ordered to leave Seo Eun-hyun for another
                    five years by the Black Scales Fish Commanding Sect. They arrive at a mountain crawling with General
                    Seos. Wei Li, a loose Four-Axis cultivator, stays to fight the puppets off. The remaining force
                    enters
                    an area filled with poisoned spiritual energy, and are forced to leave behind all Nascent Soul
                    cultivators except Myeong-hoon. Hon Ryang, Hon Cheon, and Jeon Myeong-hoon lead the remaining
                    forces,
                    but are thrown into a formation and separated. Hon Ryang is overpowered by Hong Fan. Hon Cheon and
                    Myeong-hoon meet up within the formation. Myeong-hoon listens to the “voice of lightning” and finds
                    Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>Hon Cheon and Myeong-hoon engage Eun-hyun in battle. Hon Cheon strikes with the Great Mountain
                    Splitting Emperor Technique, which only severely injures Eun-hyun. Myeong-hoon lures Eun-hyun to
                    come
                    closer and begins his advancement to Heavenly Being, striking Eun-hyun with Heavenly Tribulation.
                    Myeong-hoon pulls out a white belt, using it to summon the Heavenly Lighting Banner. He defeats
                    Eun-hyun
                    with a single attack. Myeong-hoon tells Eun-hyun to explain once he wakes up. Eun-hyun says mum as
                    the
                    matter involves True Immortals. Myeong-hoon uses the Ancestral Command to expel Eun-hyun, which also
                    change the nature of the energy of the the Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens Technique. He is
                    sealed in a jade orb. Hong Fan also surrenders. Yeon Wei escapes.</p>

                <p>Myeong-hoon returns to the sect as a hero. He is declared the next-next sect leader and renamed Jin
                    Myeong-hoon. He asks for Jin So-hae’s permission for their second wedding and promises to never
                    betray
                    the sect, his family. The Penglai has taken control of Eun-hyun’s formation and General Seo.
                    Myeong-hoon
                    enters seclusion for eight years to stabilise his realm. When he exits, he notices everyone using
                    flag
                    shaped artifacts and treasures. So-hae tells him even the elder’s belts are being replaced with
                    flags.
                    On the day of the award ceremony, happenstance leads to Jin Byuk-ho saying Zhengli’s name.</p>

                <p>Hong Su-ryeon releases Eun-hyun and asks for a final duel. She tells him she wishes to die, not by
                    the will of the heavens, but by the crossing of the swords. She says she will entrust her form of
                    death
                    to Eun-hyun, not the heavens. After their duel, Hong Su-ryeon tells Eun-hyun it was wonderful, which
                    also meant she loved him in Korean. Eun-hyun too confesses his love after her death. He returns her
                    body
                    to the earth with the White Orchid Blessing. Through her words, he realises that according to
                    Su-jin’s
                    Non-Human Theory, Enders are the worst non-humans. He then activates Extinguishing Divine

                    Heavens.</p>

                <p>A projection of the Owner of Heavenly Punishment’s eye appears to the sky. Myeong-hoon attempts to
                    push the Heavenly Lighting Banner out of the dimension following the advice of the lightning. The
                    entire
                    sect attacks Myeong-hoon. Zhengli traumatises Myeong-hoon by replacing all of his memories with
                    white-haired women. Myeong-hoon loses his fighting spirit and rushes to So-hae. The voice of
                    lightning
                    begins desperately chanting “Return to thee”, as Heavenly Punishment’s intent truly appears.
                    Eun-hyun
                    uses Extinguishing Divine Tribulating Heavens and offers himself as the sacrifice, blessing the sect
                    while cursing himself. Heavenly Punishment is enraged. Zhengli call his name thrice, but Eun-hyun
                    remains unaffected. The destruction of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect has changed from
                    instantaneous to gradual. As So-hae dies amidst the Tribulation, she tells Myeong-hoon to never
                    betray
                    his family. She leaves nothing but a fried hand. Heavenly Punishment prophecies Myeong-hoon will
                    meet
                    him again and closes their eye. As Myeong-hoon swears revenge, Eun-hyun emerges and tells him to
                    worry
                    about the survivors. Eun-hyun pours curses on Myeong-hoon until his rage cools. He says several of
                    Core
                    Formation and below have survived. He says they must descend to the Head Realm.</p>

                <p>Myeong-hoon and Eun-hyun collect all the disciples they can. As they are travelling to the True Devil
                    Realm, a bolt of Heavenly Tribulation falls on Eun-hyun, through Extinguishing Divine Tribulating
                    Heavens. Eun-hyun quickly contacts Kim Yeon, who is at Three Flowers, and asks for a favour.
                    Eun-hyun
                    and Myeong-hoon quickly leave for True Devil.</p>

                <p>The speed of the Heavenly Tribulation gradually picks up. As Eun-hyun continues dancing within the
                    Tribulation, his Heart Tribe cultivation accumulates. All of the senses have been destroyed by the
                    lightning. Myeong-hoon feels as if Eun-hyun has numerous mouths within the “world of lightning”. At
                    the
                    same time, his Immortal Beast Seed begins merging with the Formless Sword. They eventually find Yeon
                    Jin/Wei, and the latter heals Eun-hyun, who is drawn out of his trance. The formation they had set
                    has
                    now gathered enough life force for Yeon Wei to possess Yuan Yu. As they descend and Eun-hyun slices
                    apart another Tribulation, he feels the Formless Sword gain life. He has reached the next realm. On
                    their way downwards, they brush against a Golden Peng, and the travel time is shortened to thirty
                    seconds. They land on Shattered Heaven Peak. They have the remaining disciples of the Golden
                    Heavenly
                    Thunder Sect perform the Consoling Lighting Ritual to weaken the strength of the Tribulation. She
                    creates a formation to help Eun-hyun withstand the Tribulation, and he includes both her and Jeon
                    Myeong-hoon in the sacrifice. While she is explaining the formation to the two of them, Kim
                    Young-hoon
                    appears and offers a hand. Eun-hyun explains the situation to him, and Young-hoon insists on being
                    part
                    of the sacrificial offerings. As they cut down the Tribulation, Kim Young-hoon and Seo Eun-hyun
                    exchange
                    their names of the Third Manifestation–Shattering Heavens and Tribulating Heavens.</p>

                <p>Two days later, the lightning has not stopped. Myeong-hoon has reached Grand Perfection of Heavenly
                    Being through absorption of the power alone. Yeon Wei is forced to leave Yuan Yu’s body. On Hong
                    Fan’s
                    advice, Kim Young-hoon takes her place. To everyone’s confusion, the power Myeong-hoon is
                    transferring
                    to Eun-hyun suddenly increases. The characters for Red Lightning Heavenly Tribulation, Extinguishing
                    Divine Tribulating Heavens, and Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder appear over Myeong-hoon, Eun-hyun and
                    Young-hoon respectively. The Consoling Lighting Ritual gains strength. Using the massive amounts of
                    spiritual energy transferred from Myeong-hoon, Eun-hyun reaches the Heavenly Being stage.
                    Simultaneously, he reaches Grand Perfection in both Heaven and Earth. He forms the Three Great
                    Ultimates, which amplifies his power. Zhengli manipulates the Tribulation into moving towards the
                    weaker
                    disciples, but Yeon Wei blocks it. The lightning then focuses on Yeon Jin. Myeong-hoon saves Yeon
                    Jin,
                    while the remnant of Yang Su-jin on Shatter Heaven Peak pushes Eun-hyun into the plane of fate.
                    Eun-hyun
                    severs the ‘fate’ of the Tribulations. He falls into Young-hoon’s and Myeong-hoon’s arms and faints.
                </p>

                <p>Within his consciousness, Eun-hyun meets Yang Su-jin’s remnant. He tells this remnant he strongly
                    disagrees with Yang Su-jin’s non-human theory, as Enders are also non-humans. This remnant agrees,
                    saying the remnant left in the Netherworld was from before his confrontation with ■■. He tells
                    Eun-hyun
                    to not follow in his footsteps and vanishes.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Upon awakening, Eun-hyun tells Young-hoon he has realised the latter has reached the First Step
                    Before the Throne, and the one in front of him is merely an avatar. They immediately begin sparring.
                    At
                    some point in the spar, Eun-hyun realises he has begun to hear the voice Young-hoon could hear the
                    entire time, albeit in a much weaker form. The spar ends with Kim Young-hoon admitting his loss.
                    They
                    return to where Jeon Myeong-hoon is and accompany him to Shattered Heaven Peak, where the Golden
                    Divine
                    Thunder Sect has re-established themselves. Jin Hae-min, descendant of Jin Jin-chan and a Core
                    Formation
                    cultivator, is the new Sect Leader. The sect holds a memorial for all those who have died. Towards
                    the
                    end of the service, Myeong-hoon announces his intent to avenge the sect against the Owner of
                    Heavenly
                    Punishment. While Eun-hyun and Myeong-hoon stand vigil at the graves, Myeong-hoon tells him anger is
                    a
                    cycle. He also says, "Life is… essentially anger". Eun-hyun merely tells Myeong-hoon to remember to
                    lay
                    Jin So-hae to rest in the Head Realm.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun meets with Young-hoon again. Young-hoon tells him the events that transpired in his absence.
                </p>

                <p>An alliance called the Pure Friends Alliance was formed under the Cheongmun Clan. The cultivators
                    were also very interested in Young-hoon, a martial artist protected by a Core Formation fox. As a
                    result
                    of this and the fox’s thrashing, Young-hoon rose to Five Energies in five years. Core Formation
                    Cheongmun Ryeong and Young-hoon became friends after a battle. Song Jin later made a request to the
                    Alliance in order to enter the Astronomical Observatory of the Sea Dragon Tribe, and invited magic
                    artifact artisans to repair the Nether Crossing Ship. One of these was Buk Hyang-hwa. On breaching
                    the
                    Observatory, Song Jin requested Cheongmun Ryeon to interpret the data. When Kim Young-hoon went to
                    visit
                    Ryeong after reaching Treading Heavens, he found a crazed Ryeong eating the interpreted data. Ryeong
                    attacked Young-hoon and nearly killed him. The Alliance led several campaigns against Ryeong, and
                    failed
                    to cause any significant damage. The expeditions depended on the Buk Hyang Fleet, which used an ore
                    obtained from the crazed Ryeong’s stomach. With the intention of saving his friend, Kim Young-hoon
                    reached the next realm, which he has left unnamed. During the final battle, Cheongmun Ryeong regains
                    consciousness and tells Young-hoon he had been struggling with an entity inside him to prevent it
                    from
                    breaking out. To figure out a way to save Cheongmun Ryeon, upgrade the Buk Hyang fleet, and find a
                    way
                    to deal with Seo Hweol, Song JIn, Seo Ran, Buk Hyang-hwa and Kim Young-hoon ascended to the Ancient
                    Force Realm. After hearing this tale, Eun-hyun asks to be led to Cheongmun Ryeong. During the
                    journey,
                    Young-hoon tells Eun-hyun the ore induces madness, but Hyang-hwa seems to be immune. She believes
                    this
                    is due to the norigae, which confuses Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>Young-hoon and Eun-hyun enter the Astronomical Observatory. Inside, Eun-hyun sees the character for
                    Mountain (山), Summit (頂上), Thirty-three (三十三). They enter the room where Ryeong is supposedly in a
                    coma,
                    and find a large pillar of salt with the words Audience Chamber (謁見室) written below it. Young-hoon
                    tells
                    him all those that come into contact with the pillar turn to salt. Intent still flows from the
                    pillar in
                    a way similar to those ‘returning’ to a higher being. Eun-hyun and Young-hoon part, and the former
                    goes
                    to Yanguo to read the data of the heavens. He goes to a noodle shop to interpret the data.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Inside the noodle shop, he manages to interpret the data into the shape of an inverted cone that
                    vanishes when he manifests it. He takes a look at his disciples and stops by to allow Hong Fan to
                    break
                    out of the jade bead. He is attacked by 500 Qi Building Cultivators who have arrived to check on the
                    sudden disturbance and to bring Hong Fan to their overlord. Eun-hyun easily intimidates the
                    cultivators
                    and goes to meet their leader, the Jin Clan Head. The pet demon beast of the Clan Head is Hong Fan’s
                    sister. He says he has no attachment to his family as his only will is to serve Seo Eun-hyun. He
                    also
                    suddenly loses his temper when he senses an insult to Eun-hyun.</p>

                <p>While Jeon Myeong-hoon is receiving guests from all over the Head Realm, he receives worrying news
                    about Eun-hyun and rushes over to the noodle shop, where Eun-hyun has begun turning into a salt
                    pillar.
                    Hong Fan wakes him up using formless poison. From the inverted triangle, he saw what the Owner of
                    Salt
                    Mountain left behind. This also pulled him into a dream that perfectly replicated circumstances in
                    the
                    Head Realm, such as the Jin Clan Head’s demon beast pet. He also learns a part of the formula Great
                    Mountain Splitting Emperor technique.[2] Once Eun-hyun regains his senses, he tells Myeong-hoon the
                    both
                    of them, along with Hong Fan and Yeon Jin/Wei, must ascend immediately. They use a ship from the
                    Buk-hyang fleet to ascend. While ascending, they see numerous vestiges that die when struck with a
                    strike from Tribulating Heavens or Heavenly Tribulation. During the ascension, Myeong-hoon and
                    Eun-hyun
                    look downwards and promptly lose consciousness. They are awakened by Hong Fan. Eun-hyun remembers
                    seeing
                    something profoundly disgusting, while Myeong-hoon remembers something beautifully nostalgic. As
                    they
                    continue their journey, they are swallowed by a vestige. The interior of the vestige resembles a
                    small
                    world. They destroy the vestige and move on, ascending to the Bright Cold Realm. They are forced to
                    confront Hon Won. Eun-hyun fights him for a while until Hon Won uses the Great Mountain Splitting
                    Emperor Technique twice in a row, killing him.</p>
