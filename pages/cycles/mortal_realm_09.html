                <p>When Eun-hyun awakens, he is stunned to find he has now regressed back to when the vestige had
                    swallowed them; his regression point has reset. He still feels the three pulls of attraction
                    force–one to Bright Cold, another by the Nether Crossing Ship, and one from the Immortal Beast
                    Blood. Eun-hyun inserts a Gu within Yuan Yu and sends it off in the direction of the force felt by
                    the Ship. His companions enter the Peach Garden Painting as soon as they land on the Flying Immortal
                    Platform. Eun-hyun takes the scroll and flees. Hon Won chases him for a while before sending out an
                    attack force of Four-Axis cultivators, which Eun-hyun defeats easily. Seo Hweol appears out of
                    nowhere and proposes an alliance. Hweol also hints at knowing Eun-hyun, Myeong-hoon and Hong Fan are
                    True Immortals. Hweol also lies and says he is Blood Yin. Eun-hyun also lies and hints at a
                    connection to Netherworld. Hweol also reveals Hon Won obtained the Supervisory Eye right before
                    their ascension. Eun-hyun bids Hweol farewell and kills him. He keeps Seo Hweol’s face.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Yuan Yu has ascended. He finds himself on the Black Ghost Valley’s secret Flying Immortal
                    Platform. When asked for an introduction, he blurts out the name Seo Li. He undergoes the joining
                    process for Black Ghost Valley.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun sends Myeong-hoon and Hong Fan off to the ruins of the Thunder Sect, while he attacks the
                    Integration Grand Cultivators of the Human Alliance. He is confronted by six cultivators, and fights
                    Inspector Wi Ryeon-shin. Once Eun-hyun has proven himself, he is accepted as an Integration level
                    powerhouse of the Human Race Alliance.</p>
                <p>Seo Li passes the entrance examination for the Valley, accidentally killing the examiner. While being
                    taken to accept a Ghost King, he learns the Valley offers several resurrection opportunities. When
                    Li enters the shrine, all the Ghost Kings mistake him for a Reaper of the Underworld and flee. Seo
                    Li is forced to cover himself in curses. He obtains a loyal servant in a Ghost King called Bi Yul,
                    whose family developed the Yin Soul Ghost incantation.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun receives a threatening letter from Gyu Ryeon. He plans to have Oh Hyun-seok retreat from the
                    True Devil Realm, saving the Azure Tiger Saint, He also plans to send the Mad Lord to Hyeon Eum to
                    keep the latter in check.</p>
                <p>Seo Li is guided to the Method Repository. With Bi Yul’s help, he takes the Ghost Immortal Kui
                    Devilish Secrets but is warned about the difficulty. He heads to the Duty Hall and accepts a task
                    put out by the Black Scaled Fish Commanding Sect requiring a curse sorcerer.</p>

        <section id="avenger" class="cycle-section">

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Eun-hyun uses the face of Seo Hweol to disguise himself and attacks the portal to the True Devil
                    Realm, destabilising it. This forces an early retreat, and plants the doubt of Hweol’s survival in
                    Gyu Ryeon’s mind. Right after the mission, Eun-hyun receives a message from Myeong-hoon, telling him
                    four or five disciples of the Golden Divine Heavenly Thunder Sect are in the Nether Ghost Realm,
                    researching the Five Blessings Axes. Eun-hyun is very interested by the news of the Axes and
                    disregards the disciples, much to Seo Li’s confusion.</p>
                <p>Seo Li practices the Devilish Secrets, which he finds surprisingly simple. He masters the technique
                    in the hour. The next day, he leaves for the Commanding Sect. Bi Yul tells him it is possible the
                    mission was ordered by someone of the Earth Tribe.</p>
                <p>Gyu Ryeon is contacted by the Commanding Sect and told the curse sorcerers have been gathered. She is
                    looking for a poison cultivator and swears revenge on Seo Eun-hyun for having killed Seo Hweol.</p>
                <p>The Commanding Sect subjects the gathered curse sorcerers to a trial. They are to pass through the
                    gates without touching the Bi, a creature made from Vestiges, in front of it. Seo Li uses his curse
                    to melt a passageway through the Bi and walks through it. Bi Yul tells him Vestiges are husks left
                    when ascending to True Immortality. More tests follow, and Seo Li continues leading the pack. In the
                    end, only ten curse sorcerers remain. Seo Li tours the sect with Hyeon Gwi before the mission
                    begins. He learns the old symbol was that of a [Black Snake Biting its Tail], which enraged their
                    patron, Hyeon Eum.</p>
                <p>On hearing this, Eun-hyun asks Hong Fan if he has felt any callings from higher beings as he
                    practices Serpent Cultivation techniques. Hong Fan replies in the negative. He also asks for going
                    to the True Dragon Alliance Territory to complete a job. After Hong Fan leaves, Myeong-hoon arrives
                    and tells him he has found a path to Nether Ghost, and also found out Kang Min-hee is on the ‘side
                    path’ to the Nether Ghost Realm. Myeong-hoon asks Eun-hyun to contact Min-hee as they seemed to have
                    a good relationship. Eun-hyun, however, remembers their relationship as awkward, as they had dated
                    for a brief while before breaking up. Seo Li decides to collect information before having Eun-hyun
                    contact Min-hee. He learns she has not changed much, so Eun-hyun decides to use Kim Yeon instead, as
                    he does not want to force her to open the side path for a “mere couple of disciples”.</p>
                <p>Seo Li is worried about how the main body disregards the disciple of the Golden Divine Heavenly
                    Thunder Sect. He resolves to cultivate further and unearth the root. As he cultivates, Li unlocks
                    Nether Perception. He also rises to late Nascent Soul. By the next day, he has reached Grand
                    Perfection of Nascent Soul to his own dumbfoundment. He continues to assist the Commanding Sect in
                    creating the curse. When Eun-hyun is leaving to take a break, Hyeon Gwi tells him they plan to
                    escape from the grasp of the Black Dragon King, and they require items from the Lofty Dragon’s
                    storage scroll to escape. Eun-hyun agrees to help, and receives a Book in the language of the
                    Netherworld titled “Ritual Scripture of the Wealth Virtue”, which will grant him a Five Blessings
                    Wealth Axes.</p>

                <p>Eun-hyun and Myeong-hoon go to rescue Kim Yeon. When the Mad Lord appears, Eun-hyun begins calling
                    him “Old Man”, similar to Seo Hweol. He tells him Hweol is getting married and gives him the
                    coordinates for the Black Dragon King. He enters the Fortress and pretends he is getting to know his
                    new home. He finds Kim Yeon and discovers she has reached the Pinnacle Realm. They exit the
                    fortress. Eun-hyun strikes the Mad Lord with the Sea of Righteousness and Mountain of Grace,
                    allowing him to regain his senses for a while. Jo Yeon tells them to escape while he is sane. He
                    also sends along teaching material for Kim Yeon. While reading the message, Eun-hyun feels as if Seo
                    Li’s fears are true.</p>
                <p>Seo Li is relieved to learn the main body has realised there's something wrong. He goes to introduce
                    himself to Kang Min-hee in the Ghost Soul Hall. Bi Yul attempts to have Seo Li accepted into the
                    Hall, and Min-hee tells him to return with a thousand merit points. Seo Li introduces himself and
                    asks if this is her main body. Min-hee tells him her main body is on the side path to the Nether
                    Ghost Realm, and has reached Four-Axes. She and Seo Li converse for a while. She tells him he
                    reminds her of someone.</p>
                <p>Kim Yeon tells Eun-hyun she is resolved to pursue the Wonderfully Mysterious Innate Heart Canon to
                    its limit. Eun-hyun goes to attend the Grand Cultivators meeting. There he learns the Alliance
                    believes the Black Dragon King has betrayed them. When Hon Won says he should have killed Hyeon Eum
                    when he had the chance, Grand Cultivator Eung mentions his fiance, driving him into a rage. Tae
                    Yeol-jeon intimidates him into staying calm.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>After the meeting, Eun-hyun goes up to Tae Yeol-jeon, who is also from the Heart Tribe and a nun.
                    They have a ten-move spar. She tells him her meaning is to be the ‘Highest’. Her manifestation is
                    called Heart and Heaven Taenghwa Painting. Eun-hyun realises her techniques are not meant to kill,
                    but to impart enlightenment on the opponent. He hears the Formless sword echo his sentiments of the
                    Dao. Inside Yeol-jeon’s heart essence, he sees seven colossal Heavenly Kings are seated inside an
                    enormous Taenghwa, forming a circle beneath a white lotus and wearing benevolent smiles. She tells
                    him the Seven Brilliance Kings are beings bringing enlightenment. She invites him to her Temple.</p>
                <p>Hyeon Eum rises out of the rubble of his palace. He has been in battle with the Mad Lord. He seems to
                    realise the latter is a True Immortal, as he uses Immortal Arts. He respectfully monologues for a
                    while, until the Mad Lord gets bored and kills him.</p>
                <p>Seo Li and the other curse sorcerers at the Black Scaled Fish Commanding Sect are told to stop and
                    leave. In the Serving Command Arc, Gyu Ryeon’s successor and sister, Gyu Hwa, tells her the Mad Lord
                    was looking for Seo Hweol. She says it is possible he is cheating on her with his human pet, and
                    used Eun-hyun as a scapegoat.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun and Kim Yeon go to meet Tael Yeol-jeon at the Grand Nirvana Hall. She tells them about the
                    Seven Brilliance Kings and the Future King. Eun-hyun feels sick after listening to this story, and
                    as a result, Seo Li vomits blood in front of Kang Min-hee. Eun-hyun goes to sleep for a while.</p>
                <p>Kang Min-hee gives Seo Li a pill to recover. He is worried about the safety of both the main body and
                    Kim Yeon. Min-hee tells him a story from Earth, when Eun-hyun got sick because he gave her his
                    umbrella, and says she wishes she had caught the cold instead. Once the main body awakens, Seo Li
                    tells Eun-hyun everything except Min-hee’s last statement.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun and Tael Yeol-jeon discuss her manifestation. He receives a few methods to reach Integration
                    from her. After they return to Heavenly Cauldron Mountain, Eun-hyun asks Kim Yeon to contact
                    Min-hee. Min-hee asks for a meeting after the full moon.</p>
                <p>Seo Li is assigned a mission to open a gate for the Grand Elder Kang Min-hee into the Bright Cold
                    Realm after the full moon. Min-hee has Seo Li stay while she waits for Kim Yeon. As they talk, Seo
                    Li naturally falls into the habits Eun-hyun displayed while dating Min-hee. Kim Yeon arrives a while
                    later. During their conversation, Yeon asks for Min-hee’s permission to date Eun-hyun. Min-hee
                    happily gives it. At the end of their conversation, Yeon tells Min-hee Jeon Myeong-hoon needs to use
                    the side path to rescue the disciples of his sect. Min-hee agrees to let him through.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun summons Yeon Wei and asks her about the Nether Ghost Realm. He also asks her about Hon Won.
                    Yeon Wei reveals the two were actually betrothed. While Eun-hyun listens to her tale, Kang Min-hee
                    attacks Seo Li, mistaking him for a Ghost King that followed her around on Earth.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun learns Hon Won suddenly fell in love with a non-existent disciple of the Golden Divine
                    Heavenly Thunder Sect, called Cheon Ra. He developed this sudden delusion as a result of facing a
                    god-like being. Yeon Wei was forced to annihilate her sect on orders from the Sacred Master of
                    Bright Cold, Baek Woon, and managed to cure Hon Won. As a result, Hon Won believes his lover was
                    killed by Yeon Wei. The main body believes Hon Won is more pitiful; Seo Li believes Yeon Wei is.
                    This disagreement in their thoughts confuses Seo Li even further.</p>
                <p>As the fight with Kang Min-hee progresses, Seo Li decides to rise to Heavenly Being. As he does so,
                    he glimpses a path death, presumably his original Ender fate. He creates a devilish technique that
                    only sucks in heaven and earth energy from inanimate objects with a radius of 1000 li, and names it
                    Great Desert To Dead Sea. He has Eun-hyun retrieve the mind healing art, Spirit Sealing Bodkin, to
                    heal Min-hee. The main body passes on the art, and also warns Seo Li to keep his emotions in check.
                    Seo Li rises to late Heavenly Being, and uses the art on her. At the same time, he receives the Vast
                    Cold Heavenly Circle as a gift for blessing In and Yeon. Min-hee regains her senses and realises Seo
                    Li is Eun-hyun’s clone. As a result of the treatment, she realises the Ghost from Earth has died.
                    She forgets about realising Seo Li is a clone of Eun-hyun, due to the main body sealing it. Seo Li
                    has an argument with the main body over this.</p>

                <p>Hong Fan returns from the poison job, which he says has gotten cancelled. He states a problem has
                    appeared in Eun-hyun’s consciousness waves. He also expresses an interest in Buddhism on spotting
                    the manuals, so Eun-hyun takes him to the Grand Nirvana Temple. Upon seeing Tael Yeol-jeon, Hong Fan
                    immediately proposes. He is incredibly agitated. Tael Yeol-jeon, being a nun, naturally refuses.
                    Hong Fan is crushed. On Eun-hyun’s questioning, Hong Fan says he felt forgotten memories surface
                    when he faced her. Eun-hyun returns to his cave residence in a bad mood where he meets Seo Li. Li
                    tells Eun-hyun he has a gentle smile on his face. He says he will seal the main body in his cave.
                    Eun-hyun agrees and enters the cave. Just before sealing the cave, Eun-hyun draws out the Formless
                    Sword at Seo Li’s request.</p>
                <p>Seo Li has realised Seo Hweol has somehow taken over the main body. He tells Hong Fan to inform the
                    Grand Cultivators he will be in seclusion for a thousand years. Three days later, they meet Oh
                    Hyun-seok, who is returning from the True Devil Realm. He has reached Grand Perfection of Nascent
                    Soul.</p>
                <p>Seo Li stands by Kang Min-hee when she meets Myeong-hoon and Kim Yeon. Seo Li is the Ghost Soul Hall
                    Chief. They send Myeong-hoon off to the side path.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun has realised Hweol is trying to take over him. Hweol has isolated Eun-hyun within his heart
                    essence. Eun-hyun vows to escape, and continues honing his martial prowess.</p>
                <p>Five years later, Kang Min-hee, who has become quite close with Seo Li, re-enters the side path. He
                    receives the Six Extremes Yin Thunder Body and begins practicing it, merging it with the Great
                    Desert to Dead Sea.</p>
                <p>Fifty years pass. Seo Li has reached Grand Perfection of Nascent Soul. He is stunned to find he
                    cannot use the Formless Sword anymore.</p>
                <p>Thirty years pass. Kang Min-hee has yet to return from the side path. Seo Li is now a Black Grand
                    Elder. He is told the side path is blocked. Heo Gwak tells him the only way to enter the side path,
                    is via the Swiftwind Domain. Seo Li feels a forboding from this name.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol, in Seo Eun-hyun, sits surrounded by the mist of the Canvas of Myriad Forms and
                    Connections. He is attempting to reverse-engineer the mist and completely supplant Eun-hyun.</p>
                <p>Three hundred and twenty years pass. Seo Li advances to the Four-Axis stage. He transforms into an
                    eighteen-headed Ghost King. Through his Six Extremes Yin Thunder Body, he manifests the six
                    extremes. Hong Fan also rises to Four-Axis, getting younger in appearance. Seo Li is contacted by
                    Heo Gwak, who requests his help in opening a side path. They connect to the side path. The two Grand
                    Elders and Seo Li go in different directions. As he keeps walking, Seo Li encounters Min-hee. She
                    has reached the Integration stage, and now remembers Seo Li is in fact Seo Eun-hyun. She teases him
                    about having forgotten the scene inside her domain. When Li asks her why she hasn’t returned, she
                    says she is taking care of the ghosts and helping them attain peace by listening to their stories.
                    She has also decided to leave Black Ghost Valley as she finds their treatment of enemy souls
                    deplorable. She intends to guide all spirits to the Underworld. She teases him a little again. He
                    gives a Gu and tells her to contact him if she ever feels odd. He then leaves.</p>
                <p>On the way out, Seo Li does not tell Heo Gwak and Heo Ryeon about Min-hee, as promised. Disappointed,
                    the three exit the side path. As Seo Li leaves the path, he feels a voice deep inside him say he
                    should have done all he could. In her domain, Kang Min-hee wishes Eun-hyun had told her he missed
                    her, and discards the Gu.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Hyeon Gwi and a contingent of Heavenly Being and Nascent Soul cultivators pick up Seo Li and take him
                    to the gate of Lofty Dragon’s scroll, which is a pond. The other tribes around the pond are
                    frightened by Seo Li’s appearance and consider him a hedonistic murderer. When the gateway opens,
                    Seo Li helps Hyeon Gwi and his comrades enter. They find themselves in a space similar to the Dead
                    Earth Domain. Hyeong Gwi tells him to read the celestial energy to arrive at their destination. They
                    find themselves in front of a grand ancient palace with the inscription Scroll of Lofty Dragon,
                    Envoy of Health and Care. Hyeon Gwi tells Seo Li they need him to suppress the Calamity Flame while
                    they retrieve the Heavenly Lotus Fruit and Recognising Sin Taengwa. As they proceed, Seo Li notices
                    his squad leaving traps behind. On the walls, he notices a pattern left behind by a flying sword.
                    Seo Li attempts to decipher the message but fails. Eun-hyun, within his Heart essence, deciphers the
                    message[1], and receives the power of the sword formation left behind. He integrates the words of
                    the old man in the message, and swears to break out. On exploring further, Seo Li discovers a jade
                    slip with an erotic painting. Out of respect for the previous owner, he destroys it. He receives a
                    message the owner left behind[2], which shows him a scene of everyday life. An old man is seen
                    writing about Immortal Arts[3]. Suddenly, the man stops writing and eats the book he was writing in.
                    When he regains his senses, he panics, realising he is the resurrection vessel for some Immortal. He
                    splits his stomach, releasing a strange stone. His breakdown leads him to craft erotic paintings. He
                    eventually leaves the room and dies.</p>
                <p>Seo Li compares this to Cheongmun Ryeong’s situation. He discovers a seal on the roof and undoes it
                    find a liquid in place of the stones. This liquid slightly dazes him, like a weak effect of the
                    dream in the Head Realm. Within the liquid, he discovers the formula for controlling “Clear Scale
                    Armour”. He returns to Hyeon Gwi’s group and they proceed to the second level. Before he begins
                    climbing, he meets Gyo Yeom, member of the Blood Shark Race. He tells him about the Dao Departure
                    Layer, and the Sea Offering Altar. He does not go with Seo Li as he considers him a hedonistic
                    murderer.</p>
                <p>Seo Li begins having doubts about Hyeon Gwi. He tells them he is going to the Sea Offering Altar,
                    while the rest to the Human Offering Altar. Within, he finds several Taenghwas depicting dragons. He
                    also finds a jade slip containing a journal.[4] Seo Li learns the Taenghwa were passed down from the
                    Death God. He finds them similar to the ones at the Grand Nirvana Temple.</p>
                <p>Seo Hweol has found what he believes is the pillar of the Canvas. He proceeds into the mist.</p>
                <p>In the scroll, Seo Li finds a technique called Salt Sea Returning Dew Jade and harvests a Seo Orchid
                    Fruit. He returns to Hyeon Gwi and proceeds to the Calamity Flame. Gyo Yeom has already arrived and
                    is attempting to satisfy the flames with a blood sacrifice. The Commanding Sect attacks the Earth
                    Tribe Group, who control the Calamity Flame. Seo Li subdues the Flame easily. Gyo Yeom quickly
                    escapes, but his followers are captured. He reaches the third floor and runs to the Melia Tree, only
                    to discover Nok Ju of the Tall Tree Race and Baek Wi-ik of the Paired Wings Race have claimed the
                    fruit. Gyo Yeom begs for a few drops of the juice, but the duo make flimsy excuses. In a fit of
                    rage, Gyo Yeom insults both their races.[5] Before the duo can attack, Seo Li also arrives. He says
                    they only need the fruit and the Taenghwa. Seo Li assists Gyo Yeom. They win with the assistance of
                    the Black Scaled Fish Commanding Sect. Hyeon Gwi is missing.</p>
                <p>Hyeon Gwi has found the Western Heaven Taenghwa, releasing a wave that presumably awakens Kang
                    Min-hee as the Ghost Guiding Holy Mother. Hyeon Gwi returns. Gyo Yeom receives a cup full of juice,
                    and leaves. As he leaves, Seo Li notices three characters underneath the altar; Water (氵)Departure
                    (去) Xiezhi (廌). The characters combine to give Law (灋). He remembers the Dao departure layer had
                    twenty-one dragon Taenghwas and deduces these strokes are for entering the Xiezhi Worship layer. He
                    gets on the altar and performs the dance. He finds he now has a Dream Body. He finds a side path far
                    deeper than the last one.</p>
                <p>Hyeon Gwi approaches the physical body on the altar. He asks for assistance in sealing the Karmic
                    Fire. Seo Li finds he is lying and kills him. The rest of the Commanding Sect continue attacking Seo
                    Li. They undo Hyeon Eum’s restraints and unleash their full power. The traps Seo Li assumed were for
                    other people trap him instead. He is the made the new pillar for the seal on Karmic Fire. Seo Li
                    manages to leave a Mysteriously Bizzare Gu on each of them. As they exit the Scroll, they are
                    confronted by Seo Hweol.</p>

                <p>Seo Li is shocked by Seo Hweol’s sudden appearance. He knows the barrier should have held for five
                    hundred years more. Seo Hweol says he simply had Wi Ryeon-seon open it for him. Seo Li attempts to
                    attack Seo Hweol using the Black Scaled Fish Commanding Sect cultivators, but fails. Hweol tells Seo
                    Li the scroll was made to protect the species of Bright Cold during the battle between himself and
                    Love of Virtue. He reopens the Scroll using his Health Axis and enters. He absorbs all of Seo Li’s
                    Gu, allowing the latter to observe his approach. Seo Li isn’t too worried as he is sealed, but Seo
                    Hweol appears to read his thoughts. Seo Li thinks and decides Seo Hweol cannot read all of his
                    thoughts, so he blocks him off using a multitude of useless thoughts.</p>
                <p>The Dream Body has reached the Xiezhi Worship layer. He finds himself in an Office belonging to the
                    Ancient Force True Lord, Hae Nyeong. The Body finds a jade slip with Hae Nyeong’s will.[6] The Dream
                    Body, having survived despite hearing the names of so many True Immortals, gains knowledge. He
                    learns the Clear Tears are actually the Clear Scale Armour, and exits the seal to fight Seo Hweol.
                    He traps Seo Hweol in the Armour. Cultivators from other races appear and attack Eun-hyun. All of
                    them are being controlled by Seo Hweol. Hweol breaks through and claims the body he is currently
                    possessing is merely Seo Eun-hyun’s clone. He believes Seo Li is the main body. Hweol advances to
                    the Four-Axis. Seo Li finds himself unable to interfere and his faces parasitised by Hweol. Hweol
                    attempts to forcefully parasitise Seo Li, but is rebuffed by Seo Eun-hyun. In his hand is a sword
                    that shines in all of heavens’ natural colors. Hweol cannot see the sword. Eun-hyun tells Seo Li he
                    needs his help to reclaim his body.</p>
                <p>Seo Li calls Eun-hyun the main body, while En-hyun tells him to use his name. Eun-hyun explains Seo
                    Hweol’s ability as an assimilation. Since Eun-hyun spent nearly three thousand years with the
                    brain-washing in place, he turned into a Seo Hweol.</p>
                <p>As they fight, Seo Eun-hyun tells Seo Li they have completely diverged, starting from Seo Li’s love
                    for Kang Min-hee. Seo Hweol tells the two he has found the pillar of the Canvas. Within the mist, he
                    sees woman stroking a jade norigae. He finds the norigae is the pillar, and asks for it. The woman,
                    a guest, refuses. Hweol grabs hold of the jade and sees an [inverted cone].</p>
                <p>Parts of Seo Hweol begin turning into salt. Eun-hyun and Seo Li continue with their attacks.
                    Suddenly, a part of Seo Li’s head turns to salt. All across the Three Thousand Worlds, those who
                    interacted with Seo Hweol find a part of them excreting salt.</p>

            <div class="cycle-content">
                <p>Seo Eun-hyun is still within Seo Hweol’s heart essence. He learns Hweol uses an Immortal Art, Tainted
                    Soul Filling the Heavens, and has multiple [Seo Hweols]. Within, Eun-hyun realises Hweol is not a
                    True Immortal. The Seo Hweols extract the Axes they had planted in Seo Eun-hyun’s body. Eun-hyun
                    detects something Seo Hweol was forced to leave behind in his upper Dantain. Seo Li posses Eun-hyun
                    and they manifest the Three Great Ultimates. Hweol begins sacrificing personalities to brainwash
                    Eun-hyun. On Eun-hyun’s question, he says he is saving them for someone else, hence not using
                    several on Eun-hyun. Hong Fan appears to assist the duo on Seo Li’s orders. Eun-hyun begins reciting
                    the names of True Immortals to an immobilised Hweol, who is severely injured by this. Under torture,
                    Hweol tells Eun-hyun about the woman inside his canvas. While Eun-hyun is distracted, the Karmic
                    Fire, which had been sealed by the Clear Scale Armour bursts forth and burns them. Eun-hyun is
                    afflicted by horrendous pain from the judgement of the flames. Seo Li is unaffected as he is a
                    separate entity with no significant sins. He quickly reseals the Flame. Eun-hyun decides to accept
                    this pain, the fire that will follow him through his regressions. In front of him, he sees the
                    illusion left by the Nether Devil True Lord, Yu Hao Te.</p>
                <p>Yu Hao Te invites Eun-hyun for a candid chat. Eun-hyun asks him why He doesn’t revive, to which He
                    says eternal death is a blessing. This resonates deeply with Eun-hyun. He also says He was erased by
                    ‘them’ and refuses to elaborate. On His request, Eun-hyun narrates incidents from his life. Yu Hao
                    Te comforts Eun-hyun over his perceived uselessness. Eun-hyun bids him farewell and gives him two
                    gifts: the Soul-Bearing Flower and ownership over a piece of the Clear Scale Armour.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun returns to the real world. Seo Hweol continues talking about the [woman], and manages to hit
                    Eun-hyun with a wave of brainwashing, slowing him down. However, he cannot reconnect with his
                    network of Tainted Soul Filling the Heavens. He immediately runs to the exit of the Scroll.</p>
                <p>Eun-hyun, meanwhile, has managed to decode the information packet left by Hweol thanks to the
                    brainwashing wave. He has procured the formula for Great Mountain Splitting Emperor. He gets on Hong
                    Fan and has Seo Li posses him, before chasing Seo Hweol. He uses it on Hweol, who manages to
                    neutralise it by sacrificing personas. Hweol attempts to manipulate Hong Fan but fails. Hweol barely
                    manages to exit the Scroll, before being killed in an ambush by the Mad Lord.</p>
                <p>Mad Lord reverts to Jo Yeon. He sees Eun-hyun/Seo Li emerge from the pool and chases him off.
                    Eun-hyun realises Jo Yeon has regained his sanity and sends a warning about Hweol via general Seo.
                    While they are talking, Min-hee awakens as the Ghost Guiding Holy Mother.</p>
                <p>Seo Li begins panicking. Eun-hyun attacks him for no apparent reason. During the fight, Eun-hyun asks
                    Seo Li why he doesn’t use martial arts. The latter barely avoids a stike from the imperceptible
                    Formless Sword. Eun-hyuh tells Seo Li he has everything required within him, the way Kim Young-hoon
                    pushed him to reach Entering Heavens. He agrees to help Kang Min-hee. The sudden about-turn confuses
                    Seo Li. They ask for Jo Yeon’s assistance in this task.</p>
                <p>Seo Li follows Eun-hyun into Kang Min-hee. The latter carves a path for Seo Li with his sword, and
                    stays to rescue the disciples on the Nether Crossing Ship. Seo Li follows the sword slash to
                    Min-hee’s true body. He tries to get her to wake up but falters as Min-hee sees him as a clone. He
                    is unable to move due to the effect the Holy Mother has on ghost path methods. He forcibly rips out
                    his techniques and transformation. He manages to approach Min-hee, but nearly disintegrates. Seo
                    Eun-hyun catches up. He is kept warm by Karmic Fire. Eun-hyun guides Seo Li to Entering Heavens,
                    Fallen Flowers Cannot Return to Branches. Eun-hyun draws his Formless Sword, now re-named to
                    All-Heavens Sword. Seo Li uses all his power, burning his life to convey his heart to Kang Min-hee.
                </p>
                <p>In the aftermath, Eun-hyun and Seo Li lay dying. Only Seo Li’s head is intact. They have realised Seo
                    Li will not regress. He transfers all of his knowledge and the Wealth Axis to Eun-hyun. Seo Li
                    enters eternal rest, and Eun-hyun begins his regression soon after.</p>
