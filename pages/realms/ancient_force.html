                Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain that attracts remnants of destroyed worlds and corpses of True Immortals.
                It is the corpse of Ancient Force Lord Hae Nyeong, who died after fighting [Something] alongside Vast
                Cold. The Ancient Force Realm is, quite literally, a world made up of the corpses of countless True
                Immortals.</p>

            <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">Heaven Immortals who failed in their
                prophecies, forgotten Immortal Beasts erased from history. The deaths of countless True Immortals
                overflow in the form of the Deep Sea. Among the fragments in the Deep Sea, some appear to be pieces that
                can only be described as remnants of 'Heavenly Domains'.</p>

            <section id="overview">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <div class="title-underline"></div>
                <p>The condition to ascend to this realm is to possess the strength/artifact of a destroyed world or
                    dead True Immortal. This realm does not have a Stable Realm and Chaos Realm, but rather sea domains
                    and the deep sea. Within air bubbles amidst the deep sea, the people of Ancient Force lives under
                    blue skies. The roof of such air bubbles is called the Dome Sky (穹蒼) which itself is the deep sea.
                    These are the sea domains, and Ancient Force Realm is composed of countless sea domains gathered
                    together. There are three regions in this realm:[1]</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water Flow Region</strong> - the sea domains on the outskirts of the entire Ancient
                        Force Realm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dao Departure Region</strong> - the largest sea domain at the very center of Ancient
                        Force Realm. The closer the sea domain is to the center, the larger their size. The Dao
                        Departure Region possesses its own attraction force which pulls the smaller sea domains towards
                        it, preventing them from scattering into the deep sea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Xiezhi Worship Region</strong> - a vast continent - the only continent - located at the
                        center of the Dao Departure Region, contrary to the islands of all other sea domains. It is
                        where the Sacred Master Hae Lin of the Ancient Force Realm resides.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since the sky of Ancient Force Realm is covered by the deep sea, Heaven Tribe cultivators cannot read
                    the celestial energy, rendering them at a disadvantage in information-gathering compared to the
                    Earth Tribe which reads the flow of yin and yang. Thus, this realm is almost entirely dominated by
                    demon beasts.[1]</p>

                <h3 id="ancient-stones">Ancient Stones</h3>
                <p>The deep sea consist of dimensions overlapping so densely that they appear like water. Entering the
                    deep sea unprepared traps one in the distorted space, or even sends them to a different dimension. A
                    common method to safely traverse the deep sea is to bring ancient stones, a unique substance found
                    only in Ancient Force Realm which possess the property of accumulating history. Crushing one ancient
                    stone highlights the path one had taken, while crushing ten simultaneously enacts an attraction
                    force that pulls one back along the path they had thread. It is a safety line to return from the
                    deep sea to the surface at once. Ancient stones can only be found in the deep sea, either through
                    mining or by extraction from deep sea monsters. Ancient stones are used to power artifacts and also
                    traded as currency.[1]</p>
                <p>The islands in the sea domains do not sink into the deep sea as they are suspended by veins of
                    ancient stones throughout the landmass. The ancient stone keeps the island stationary, and mining
                    these ancient stone veins is illegal. The punishment for illegal mining is to obtain ten times the
                    mass mined from the deep sea; a roundabout death sentence.[1]</p>

                <h3 id="ancient-force">Ancient force</h3>
                <p>The Ancient Force is something that originates entirely from the Head Realm. All beings who control
                    the Plane of Qi and walk the pathway of history...when they observe the threads of history, they
                    inevitably perceive threads of [lost] history among them. And when they connect with those [lost
                    histories] through their unique powers, what they gain is ancient force.</p>
                <p>Through that ancient force, some Immortal Beasts gain special authorities, some uncover unknown
                    truths, and some are said to acquire Seats that were lost long ago. However, the crucial point is
                    that anyone who obtains ancient force is said to be able to discern its origin. And the origin of
                    all ancient force is the Head Realm.</p>
                <p>In this world, there are many [forgotten histories] and [disappeared truths]. And all those who
                    gather ancient force are, in essence, beings who [excavate the truths of forgotten history].</p>
                <p>Ancient Force True Lord Hae Nyeong devoted their entire life to uncovering the hidden truths of the
                    world and 500,000 years ago, followed the Vast Cold Heavenly Lord, believing that by following, they
                    could uncover the entirety of ancient force. But they were ultimately defeated.</p>
