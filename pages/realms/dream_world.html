                Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds. This dream is connected to many high beings worshiped as gods, and
                holds the power of the Owner of Salt Mountain.</p>

            <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">This information is not confirmed, but the
                dream world seem to be at a greatly decelerated time compared to the 'real' world. In one instance, less
                than two hours in the dream world was five years outside.[1]</p>

                <p>The origin myth of the dream world was found in the secret library of the Penglai Kingdom.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "In the beginning, there existed a world full of illusionary dreams.
                    <br><br>
                    The Axle Imperial Venerable felt sorry for this and, with the help of the Wheel Imperial Venerable,
                    Hyeon Go (玄古/Black Ancient), and three Heavenly Kings, created a new heaven.
                    <br><br>
                    The Wheel Imperial Venerable rolled the wheel to guide virtuous souls under the new heaven, and the
                    Three Heavenly Kings performed all sorts of miracles to cultivate a land where we could live.
                    <br><br>
                    The Primordial Giant Hyeon Go, at the request of the Axle Imperial Venerable, made a promise to
                    prevent the snakes from entering this land.
                    <br><br>
                    The shadow of Hyeon Go when they made the promise became the flesh of our souls, giving birth to us.
                    We have two eyes and two ears... [Description of humans.]"

                <p>The Axle Imperial Venerable that Penglai Kingdom worships is the Owner of Salt Mountain. While the
                    Wheel Imperial Venerable is the Heavenly Venerable of the Netherworld. The identities of the three
                    Heavenly Kings are unknown. The identity of the snake is Light Supreme Deity and Radiance Hall.</p>

                <p>The most recent known ruler of Penglai Kingdom was Queen Yuk Yo, alongside her Prince Consort, Baek
                    Rin.</p>
                <p>The dream of Salt Mountain had been inherited by their disciple, Great Mountain Supreme Deity (太山上帝).
                    Their disciple is the grave keeper of the dream world, guarding the spirit tablet of the Salt Sea
                    Supreme Deity (鹹海上帝). Great Mountain is the administrator of Penglai and keeps out snakes. The color
                    of the light emitted by the salt crystal within the secret library of Penglai Kingdom, which was
                    white at the time of Seo Eun-hyun's first visit, was returning to its original dark red color.</p>
