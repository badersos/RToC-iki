                located in the Sun and Moon Heavenly Domain that is filled with ghostly energy. It is the corpse of
                Nether Ghost, who fought [Something] alongside Vast Cold</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <div class="title-underline"></div>
                <p>Ghosts who died in a Lower Realm reach this place after wandering the Nine Heavens.[1] Here, they
                    escape the attraction force of the Netherworld that had always pulled on them since death. Its
                    Sacred Master is Yu Oh.[2] Somewhere, there exists a shortcut to the True Immortal Realm, and the
                    True Persons above heed this realm with a watchful eye from the Astral Realm, awaiting the day the
                    coordinates are found.</p>

                <p>The sky in the Nether Ghost Realm is dark blue. In the daytime, dozens of eyes of Entering Nirvana
                    stage True Persons blot the sky like a mimicry of the stars. Should one carelessly read the
                    celestial energy during the daytime, they would become a puppet of a True Person. These poor ghosts
                    eroded by True Persons are called devotees (信者).[3] At night, the real constellations appear, and
                    their attraction force hides the gazes of True Persons, allowing one to safely read the celestial
                    energy. During this time, the yin energy of the Nether Ghost Realm also thickens, making it harder
                    for them to observe the realm.</p>

                <h2>Power Structure</h2>
                <div class="title-underline"></div>
                <p>There are four major forces in the Nether Ghost Realm. They are collectively known as the Three
                    Palaces and One Island (三宮一島)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Black Ghost Palace (黑色鬼骨宮):</strong> It's the main sect of the Black Ghost Valley.
                        It's a sinister and secretive group with a reputation for being extremely closed-off. While the
                        branch in the Bright Cold Realm is somewhat lenient in order to quickly expand its influence,
                        the main sect is different. It's said to be extremely closed off due to many hidden secrets.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Underworld Ghost Palace (幽冥鬼宮):</strong> It's the most widespread force. The
                        Underworld Ghost Palace is the most famous in the Nether Ghost Realm, and its power and
                        influence are immense. Research on Ghost Path Methods and devilish arts are actively conducted
                        there, so the methods that spread from there influence the entire Nether Ghost Realm. More than
                        80% of the methods in circulation in the Nether Ghost Realm come from the Underworld Ghost
                        Palace.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Flower Painting Western Heaven Palace (花圖西天宮):</strong> In the ghostly energy-filled
                        Nether Ghost Realm, they are lunatics who practice the Righteous Path Method of Vanquishing Evil
                        and Upholding Righteousness. Antagonistically in the Nether Ghost Realm, they gather life force
                        and the power of Vanquishing Evil and Upholding Righteousness, which is extremely effective
                        against the creatures of the Nether Ghost Realm, making them a very powerful group. Rumors
                        abound that they are connected to the 'ones above,' so it's best to avoid getting entangled with
                        them.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Penglai Island (蓬萊島):</strong> Penglai Island also follows the same Mountain God as
                        Penglai Palace. The Penglai Island in the Nether Ghost Realm knows about the Penglai Palace in
                        the Bright Cold Realm, but they have no interest in each other. They share the same name and
                        founder but do not care about each other, making them an unusual group. However, it's known that
                        the Penglai Island here practices a devilish art rather than the Great Mountain Splitting
                        Emperor Technique.</li>
