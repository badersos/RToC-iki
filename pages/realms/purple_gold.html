                <div class="title-underline"></div>
                <p>The Purple Gold Realm is one the five Middle Realms and is known for its artifacts and Dharma
                    Treasure's[1] and is also notable for producing a special treasure known as a Dusk Talisman (黃昏符)[2]
                    that assist with breaking through to the Entering Nirvana Realm. It is currently ruled by Ban Ta,
                    its Sacred Master who has ruled for over 500,000 years.[3] Other notable features include its high
                    number of Extraordinary Pattern Law Talents[4] and its Immortal Arts Library[5] although some of
                    this information might not be true as it was said as part of a sales pitch. This Realm is the corpse
                    of Purple Gold Heavenly Lord (紫金天君) Heuk Am (黑庵/Black Hermitage).</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <div class="title-underline"></div>
                <p>500,000 years ago, Sacred Master Ban Ta was captured with the help of Sacred Master Baek Woon[6] by
                    multiple True Persons, under the orders of the Radiance Eight Immortals[7] after which he was bound
                    to the realm until he can find a replacement. Ban Ta seems to hate the Esteemed Ones of his realm
                    going so far as to call them "parasite['s]"[8] and disparaging them at almost every opportunity.</p>
