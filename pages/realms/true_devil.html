                <p>A realm where demons live. Seo Hweol and Hyeon Eum are known to have been in contact with this realm.
                    The True Devil Realm is known to correspond to fire because of Karmic Fire. Originally, there were
                    plenty of metal elements as well, but due to how long the Nether Devil True Lord controlled Karmic
                    Fire, fire has a bigger proportion now.</p>

                <h3 id="blood-yin-split">The Blood Yin and True Devil Realm</h3>
                <p>In the distant past, when the True Devil Realm was whole, the Devil Realm was divided into two
                    factions: the Demonic Devils and the Heavenly Fiends. Among them, the Heavenly Fiends would consume
                    Demonic Devils as resources through their peculiar devilish arts. They were especially known for
                    techniques that eroded the minds of Demonic Devils, corrupting and turning them into eternal slaves
                    of the Heavenly Fiends, which was popular among the Heavenly Fiends at that time.</p>

                <p>The Yuchok Tribe was once enslaved by the Heavenly Fiends, but one of their ancestors countered the
                    mind erosion of the Heavenly Fiends by parasitizing the Heavenly Fiends' mind in reverse with clear
                    self-awareness and personal standpoint, battling their mental power with a technique that became the
                    origin of Mysterious Bizarre Gu.</p>

                <p>Now, the worlds have split into the Blood Yin Realm where the Heavenly Fiends reside and our True
                    Devil Realm where we Demonic Devils live. People from the Bright Cold Realm have no reason to see
                    Heavenly Fiends... but it's a well-known fact in the True Devil Realm that the Heavenly Fiends have
                    been peculiarly obsessed with the Bright Cold Realm for ages. Since you've come to the True Devil
                    Realm, you might encounter Heavenly Fiends, so I'll give you this technique.</p>

                <h3 id="bright-devil-war">The Bright-Devil Great War</h3>
                <p>There was a great war 40,000 years ago called the Bright-Devil Great War, between the Bright Cold
                    Realm and the True Devil Realm.</p>

                <p>In the Bright-Devil Great War, the True Devil Realm was defeated by the Bright Cold Realm, and
                    afterwards, it was said that the True Devil Realm had to cede some of its territories as colonies to
                    various races of the Bright Cold Realm.</p>

                <p>It was said that these races from the Bright Cold Realm would bring resources from these colonies in
                    the Devil Realm to cultivate devilish arts for their cultivators.</p>

                <p>Especially, the Human Race would buy devils from the Devil Realm as slaves and grind them into a pill
                    called Devil Origin Pill, which was sought after by many races not only for reaching the Nascent
                    Soul stage but also for cultivating in the Nascent Soul stage itself.</p>

                <p>However, the Human Race, which made the pills, only provided a little rear support during the
                    Bright-Devil Great War and could not get a share of the colonies when they were distributed. As a
                    result, it seemed that the Human Race Grand Alliance decided to use the previous incident as an
                    excuse to invade the Devil Realm and create colonies.</p>
